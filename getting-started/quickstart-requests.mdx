title: "Sending Authenticated Requests"

In the last two quickstart guides, we set up our frontend and backend. Now, we're going to make an authenticated request
from our frontend to our backend.

    ## Make an authenticated request to the backend

    To make an `authenticated` request on behalf of your user,
    you'll need to provide an access token. Access tokens are available from
    [withAuthInfo](/reference/frontend-apis/react#withauthinfo) (or similar functions, like `useAuthInfo`).
    You provide it in the request in the `Authorization` header, like so:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

    Let's update our component so it makes an authenticated fetch request to `/api/whoami`:

    ```jsx
    function whoAmI(accessToken) {
      return fetch("/api/whoami", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        },
      });
    }

    const YourApp = withAuthInfo((props) => {
      const [serverResponse, setServerResponse] = useState(undefined)

      const fetchWhoAmI = () => {
        whoAmI(props.accessToken).then(setServerResponse)
      }

      return <div>
        {props.isLoggedIn ?
          <p>You are logged in as {props.user.email}</p> :
          <p>You are not logged in</p>}
        <b>Server Response:</b>
        <pre>{serverResponse}</pre>
      </div>;
    });
    ```

    When you are logged in, you should see your user's email address in the response.
    When you are not logged in, you should see a 401 error.

    ## Make an authenticated request to the backend

    To make an `authenticated` request on behalf of your user,
    you'll need to provide an access token. Access tokens are available from
    [getAuthenticationInfoOrNull](/reference/frontend-apis/js#get-current-user-information).

    You provide it in the request in the `Authorization` header, like so:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

    One example of how to do this is with the [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API:

    ```js
    function whoAmI(accessToken) {
      return fetch("/api/whoami", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        },
      });
    }

    const authInfo = getAuthenticationInfoOrNull();

    // Make an authenticated request to the backend, if we are logged in
    if (authInfo) {
      whoAmI(authInfo.accessToken).then((response) => {
        console.log(response);
      });
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Summary

You now have all the building blocks you need to build an application. You can get the users information on the frontend,
you can make authenticated requests to the backend, and you can protect your API routes so only authenticated users can access them.

This is just the start of what you can do - in the next few guides, we'll look at how to configure your authentication experience
and add support for B2B/multi-tenant applications.
