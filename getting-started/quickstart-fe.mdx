In this guide, we're going to quickly set up signup, login, and account pages with PropelAuth.
Then we'll hook up our frontend to display the current user's information.

## Set up Signup, Login, and Account pages

After signing up for PropelAuth, create a project. A project includes everything you need to set up authentication,
like [UIs](/overview/hosted-pages), a dashboard for managing your users, [transactional emails](/overview/emails), and more.

Once we've created a project, we're actually done with this step, since PropelAuth manages our UIs for us (or you check out our [component library](/component-library) to manage it yourself).

On your dashboard, you'll see that you now have a test environment to play around with:

![test env enabled](/images/envs.png)

Click **View Login Page** and you'll be directed to the login page for your application.

<Frame caption="This is what your users will see when they go to log in to your product">
  <img alt="default login page" src="/images/default-login.png" />
</Frame>

Everything about this page is configurable, from the color scheme and logo, to the login options we present to the user (passwords, passwordless, SSO, etc.).
We'll worry about configuring it later - instead lets connect our frontend.

## Set up our frontend to display the current user's information

We've seen that our users can already sign up and log in, but how do we access that information in our product?

PropelAuth provides frontend libraries for frameworks like React, no-code tools like Webflow, and vanilla javascript
which expose interfaces for accessing the current user's information.

    ### Installation

    First, install the `@propelauth/react` library in your existing React application. If you don't have a React application yet, follow [these instructions](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    $ npm install --save @propelauth/react
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    $ yarn add @propelauth/react
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    ### Configuration

    We need to point our React application to our test environment to fetch the current user's information.
    Go to the **Frontend Integration** section of your [PropelAuth dashboard](https://app.propelauth.com), and
    copy the auth url into an `.env` file:

    ```text .env
    # Test environment only, in production, we'll use our own domain
    REACT_APP_AUTH_URL=https://something.propelauthtest.com
    ```

    Then, set up your test environment to use port 3000 (the default for React, if you are using a different port, enter that instead).
    This will configure your application to receive requests from localhost:3000 and it will now redirect to localhost:3000 after you log in.

    ![configure port 3000](/images/configure-port-3000.png)

    ### Initialization

    In your `index.js` or `index.ts` file, wrap your application with the [`AuthProvider`](/reference/frontend-apis/react#set-up-authprovider)

    ```jsx index.js
    import { AuthProvider } from "@propelauth/react";

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
    root.render(
      <AuthProvider authUrl={process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_URL}>
        <YourApp />
      </AuthProvider>,
      document.getElementById("root")
    );
    ```

    The [AuthProvider](/reference/frontend-apis/react#set-up-authprovider) is responsible for fetching the current user's authentication information.
    If your entire application requires the user to be logged in (for example, for a dashboard), use [RequiredAuthProvider](/reference/frontend-apis/react#requiredauthprovider) instead and you'll never have to check **isLoggedIn**.

    ### Display user information

    Here's a component which displays the current user's email address:

    ```jsx
    const YourApp = withAuthInfo((props) => {
        const {redirectToLoginPage, redirectToSignupPage, redirectToAccountPage} = useRedirectFunctions()
        const logoutFunction = useLogoutFunction()

        // isLoggedIn and user are injected automatically from withAuthInfo
        if (props.isLoggedIn) {
            return <div>
                <p>You are logged in as {props.user.email}</p>
                <button onClick={redirectToAccountPage}>Account</button>
                <button onClick={logoutFunction}>Logout</button>
            </div>
        } else {
            return <div>
                <p>You are not logged in</p>
                <button onClick={redirectToLoginPage}>Login</button>
                <button onClick={redirectToSignupPage}>Signup</button>
            </div>
        }
    });
    ```

    [withAuthInfo](/reference/frontend-apis/react#withauthinfo) is a higher order component which will inject
    useful properties like `isLoggedIn`, `user`, and `accessToken` into your components. Check out the [reference](/reference/frontend-apis/react#get-current-user-information) for all the
    ways you can access user information.

    We also used [useRedirectFunctions](/reference/frontend-apis/react#useredirectfunctions) to redirect to the
    login, signup, and account pages and we used [useLogoutFunction](/reference/frontend-apis/react#logout) to log the user out.

    When you aren't logged in, you'll see:

    ![logged out state](/images/quickstart-logged-out.png)

    And when you do log in, you'll see:

    ![logged in state](/images/quickstart-logged-in.png)

Great! We now have a powerful, flexible authentication experience for our users. And for us, we have all the building
blocks we need to set up our product.
