Whether you are starting with Webflow and plan to move to another framework
(e.g. React/Next.js) or if you are building something like documentation in
Webflow and want to include dynamic authenticated content, PropelAuth can help.

### Minimal example

The following example will display a different message for logged-in users vs
logged out. We'll go into more detail about how it works and show more advanced
examples down below.

```js
<script src="https://www.unpkg.com/@propelauth/javascript@2.0.0/dist/javascript.min.js"
        integrity="sha384-CnMW/GT96q1vxl3xq1fIbUrmXpDIsXVtY+/FpJW+rMSCgjlOWpbVfs5G0dg2bMN5"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script>
    const client = PropelAuth.createClient({
        authUrl: "YOUR_AUTH_URL", // Your auth URL can be found in your PropelAuth dashboard. You will have a different URL for your test and production environment, so you may want to store it in an ENV variable.
        enableBackgroundTokenRefresh: true, // PropelAuth uses short-lived tokens for security reasons. Enabling this feature will automatically refresh those tokens in the background. See technical details for more info.
    });

    client.getAuthenticationInfoOrNull().then(authInfo => {
        const element = document.getElementById("text")
        if (authInfo) {
            element.innerText = "You are logged in as " + authInfo.user.email // User contains other metadata like userId
        } else {
            element.innerText = "You are not logged in"
        }
    }
</script>
```

### Technial details

When a user logs in via your hosted pages, a secure, http-only cookie is
created. This cookie allows PropelAuth to identify logged-in users. In
production, we require you use a custom domain to avoid third-party cookie
issues for your users. Browsers like Safari will block cookies across domains,
which is why we include custom domains even in our free plan.

Afterwards, your frontend can make a request to PropelAuth to determine if the
current user is logged in and get their information.

![auth generic](/images/auth-generic-1.png)

On top of user information, your frontend will get an
[access token](/overview/access-tokens) for that user. These tokens
are JWTs, which we've written about For more information on JWTs, view our blog
[here](https://www.propelauth.com/post/jwts-explained-with-code-examples).

Later on, when your frontend makes requests to your backend, it will include an
access token, which your backend can validate and determine whose token it is.
This validation is done entirely on your backend and doesn't need to make any
requests to PropelAuth.

The access token is short-lived, and our libraries will refresh the token both
periodically and when the user switches to your tab or reconnects to the
internet.

### Configure

Go to your [PropelAuth project](https://auth.propelauth.com/signup) and click
**Frontend Integration** in the sidebar. You will see:

- **Auth URL** - This is where your authentication pages are hosted, and you
  will need this for the setup step.
- **Test Environment** - This is where you test. In our case, we'll select
  Webflow and enter our subdomain.
- **Login Redirect Path** - After a user logs in, they will be redirected here.
- **Logout Redirect Path** - After a user logs out, they will be redirected
  here.

### Installation

Add the following custom code to the `Inside <head>` tag of your page.

```js
<script
  src="https://www.unpkg.com/@propelauth/javascript@2.0.0/dist/javascript.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-CnMW/GT96q1vxl3xq1fIbUrmXpDIsXVtY+/FpJW+rMSCgjlOWpbVfs5G0dg2bMN5"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

then a global `PropelAuth` object will be created, and you can call
`createClient` from it:

```js
<script>
    PropelAuth.createClient({...});
</script>
```

### createClient

`createClient` creates an authentication client which manages your access token,
fetches user information, and provides other useful authentication functions.

The client also refreshes auth information when a user switches focus to your
tab or reconnects (if they were offline).

```js
const client = createClient({
  authUrl: "REPLACE_ME", // The base URL where your authentication pages are hosted. You can find this under the Frontend Integration section for your project.
  enableBackgroundTokenRefresh: true, // If true, periodically refresh the access token in the background. This helps ensure you always have a valid token ready to go. Default true.
});
```

### Usage

[getAuthenticationInfoOrNull](/reference/frontend/javascript) will return user
metadata and the current user's organizations.

You can see a full list of methods on the client in our
[reference](/reference/frontend/javascript). Here's an example which creates
signup/login/logout buttons that change based on whether the user is logged in
or not.

We start with two different divs - one with id `display-when-logged-in` and one
with id `display-when-logged-out`.

![display when logged in display when logged in](/images/display-when-logged-in.png)

![display when logged in display when logged out](/images/display-when-logged-out.png)

Each element that needs an interaction also has a name, for example, here is an
image with the id `profile-picture`.

![profile picture id](/images/profile-picture.png)

Finally, we can use custom code to hook up all these elements:

```js
<script>
    const client = PropelAuth.createClient({
        authUrl: "https://auth.yourdomain.com", // Change me
        enableBackgroundTokenRefresh: true,
    });

    // Set up each element to go to a PropelAuth hosted page or logout
    document.getElementById("signup").onclick = client.redirectToSignupPage;
    document.getElementById("login").onclick = client.redirectToLoginPage;
    document.getElementById("profile-picture").onclick = client.redirectToAccountPage;
    document.getElementById("logout").onclick = client.logout;

    // Update the page based on the auth information we fetch from PropelAuth
    function updatePage() {
        client.getAuthenticationInfoOrNull().then(authInfo => {
            if (authInfo) {
                document.getElementById("profile-picture").src = authInfo.user.pictureUrl;
                document.getElementById("display-when-logged-in").style.display = "revert";
                document.getElementById("display-when-logged-out").style.display = "none";
            } else {
                document.getElementById("display-when-logged-in").style.display = "none";
                document.getElementById("display-when-logged-out").style.display = "revert";
            }
        })
    }

    // Whenever our user logs in or out, update the page
    client.addLoggedInChangeObserver(updatePage);
</script>
```

Here's what an example application looks like. Note that all we did was create
the 2 divs, 3 buttons, and 1 image. The rest is our hosted pages.

**Troubleshooting**

If you have any issues seeing the logged-in user, check the FAQ.

### Making an authenticated HTTP request

There are a lot of ways to make HTTP requests in Javascript. You could use the
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch),
[XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest),
or a library like [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

Whichever you choose, to make an **authenticated** request on behalf of your
user, you'll need to provide an access token. Access tokens are available from
getAuthenticationInfoOrNull. You provide it in the request in the
`Authorization` header, like so:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

With the Fetch API, this looks like:

```js
function whoAmI(accessToken) {
  return fetch("/whoami", {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
  });
}
```
