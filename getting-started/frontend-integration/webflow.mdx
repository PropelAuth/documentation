Whether you are starting with Webflow and plan to move to another framework
(e.g. React/Next.js) or if you are building something like documentation in
Webflow and want to include dynamic authenticated content, PropelAuth can help.

## Minimal example

The following example will display a different message for logged-in users vs
logged out. We'll go into more detail about how it works and show more advanced
examples down below.

```html
<script src="https://www.unpkg.com/@propelauth/javascript@2.0.0/dist/javascript.min.js"
        integrity="sha384-CnMW/GT96q1vxl3xq1fIbUrmXpDIsXVtY+/FpJW+rMSCgjlOWpbVfs5G0dg2bMN5"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script>
    const client = PropelAuth.createClient({
        // Your auth URL can be found in your PropelAuth dashboard. 
        authUrl: "YOUR_AUTH_URL", 
        // PropelAuth uses short-lived tokens for security reasons. 
        // Enabling this feature will automatically refresh those tokens in the background. See technical details for more info.
        enableBackgroundTokenRefresh: true, 
    });

    client.getAuthenticationInfoOrNull().then(authInfo => {
        const element = document.getElementById("text")
        if (authInfo) {
            // User contains other metadata like userId
            element.innerText = "You are logged in as " + authInfo.user.email 
        } else {
            element.innerText = "You are not logged in"
        }
    }
</script>
```

## How it works

For a detailed description of what's going on under the hood, see [here](/overview/how-our-auth-works).

## Configure

Go to your [PropelAuth project](https://auth.propelauth.com/signup) and click
**Frontend Integration** in the sidebar. You will see:

- **Auth URL** - This is where your authentication pages are hosted, and you
  will need this for the setup step.
- **Test Environment** - This is where you test. In our case, we'll select
  Webflow and enter our subdomain.
- **Login Redirect Path** - After a user logs in, they will be redirected here.
- **Logout Redirect Path** - After a user logs out, they will be redirected
  here.

## Installation

Add the following custom code to the `Inside <head>` tag of your page.

```html
<script
  src="https://www.unpkg.com/@propelauth/javascript@2.0.0/dist/javascript.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-CnMW/GT96q1vxl3xq1fIbUrmXpDIsXVtY+/FpJW+rMSCgjlOWpbVfs5G0dg2bMN5"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

then a global `PropelAuth` object will be created, and you can call
`createClient` from it:

```html
<script>
    PropelAuth.createClient({...});
</script>
```

### createClient

`createClient` creates an authentication client which manages your access token,
fetches user information, and provides other useful authentication functions.

The client also refreshes auth information when a user switches focus to your
tab or reconnects (if they were offline).

```js
const client = createClient({
  // The base URL where your authentication pages are hosted. You can find this under the Frontend Integration section for your project.
  authUrl: "REPLACE_ME", 
  // If true, periodically refresh the access token in the background. This helps ensure you always have a valid token ready to go. Default true.
  enableBackgroundTokenRefresh: true, 
});
```

## Usage

[getAuthenticationInfoOrNull](/reference/frontend-apis/js#get-current-user-information) will return user
metadata and the current user's organizations.

You can see a full list of methods on the client in our
[reference](/reference/frontend-apis/js). Here's an example which creates
signup/login/logout buttons that change based on whether the user is logged in
or not.

We start with two different divs - one with id `display-when-logged-in` and one
with id `display-when-logged-out`.

![display when logged in display when logged in](/images/display-when-logged-in.png)

![display when logged in display when logged out](/images/display-when-logged-out.png)

Each element that needs an interaction also has a name, for example, here is an
image with the id `profile-picture`.

![profile picture id](/images/profile-picture.png)

Finally, we can use custom code to hook up all these elements:

```js
<script>
    const client = PropelAuth.createClient({
        authUrl: "https://auth.yourdomain.com", // Change me
        enableBackgroundTokenRefresh: true,
    });

    // Set up each element to go to a PropelAuth hosted page or logout
    document.getElementById("signup").onclick = client.redirectToSignupPage;
    document.getElementById("login").onclick = client.redirectToLoginPage;
    document.getElementById("profile-picture").onclick = client.redirectToAccountPage;
    document.getElementById("logout").onclick = client.logout;

    // Update the page based on the auth information we fetch from PropelAuth
    function updatePage() {
        client.getAuthenticationInfoOrNull().then(authInfo => {
            if (authInfo) {
                document.getElementById("profile-picture").src = authInfo.user.pictureUrl;
                document.getElementById("display-when-logged-in").style.display = "revert";
                document.getElementById("display-when-logged-out").style.display = "none";
            } else {
                document.getElementById("display-when-logged-in").style.display = "none";
                document.getElementById("display-when-logged-out").style.display = "revert";
            }
        })
    }

    // Whenever our user logs in or out, update the page
    client.addLoggedInChangeObserver(updatePage);
</script>
```

Here's what an example application looks like. Note that all we did was create
the 2 divs, 3 buttons, and 1 image. The rest is our hosted pages.

**Troubleshooting**

If you have any issues seeing the logged-in user, check the [FAQ](/overview/faq).

## Making an authenticated HTTP request

There are a lot of ways to make HTTP requests in Javascript. You could use the
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch),
[XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest),
or a library like [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

Whichever you choose, to make an **authenticated** request on behalf of your
user, you'll need to provide an access token. Access tokens are available from
getAuthenticationInfoOrNull. You provide it in the request in the
`Authorization` header, like so:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

With the Fetch API, this looks like:

```js
function whoAmI(accessToken) {
  return fetch("/whoami", {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
  });
}
```
