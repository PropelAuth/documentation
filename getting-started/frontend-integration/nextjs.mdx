## Quick example

The following example will display a different message for logged-in users vs
logged out. We'll go into more detail about how it works and show more advanced
examples below.

<CodeGroup>

```jsx pages/_app.jsx
import { AuthProvider } from "@propelauth/react";

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  // Your auth URL can be found in your PropelAuth dashboard. 
  // We are using an ENV variable because you will have a different URL for your test and production environment.
  return (
    <AuthProvider authUrl={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROPELAUTH_AUTH_URL}> 
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
};

export default MyApp;
```

```jsx pages/index.js
import { withAuthInfo } from "@propelauth/react";

const IndexPage = withAuthInfo((props) => {
  // isLoggedIn and user are injected automatically from withAuthInfo
  if (props.isLoggedIn) {
    return <div>You are logged in as {props.user.email}</div>;
  } else {
    return <div>You are not logged in</div>;
  }
});

export default IndexPage;
```

</CodeGroup>

## How it works

For a detailed description of what's going on under the hood, see [here](/overview/how-our-auth-works).

## Configure your project

Go to your [PropelAuth project](https://auth.propelauth.com/signup) and click
**Frontend Integration** in the sidebar. You will see:

- **Port** - The port your app runs on locally. The default for Next.js is 3000.
After entering `3000`, your test environment will allow requests from
`http://localhost:3000`.
- **Login Redirect Path** - After a user logs in, they will be redirected here.
For example,`/` will redirect them to `http://localhost:3000/`.
- **Logout Redirect Path** - After a user logs out, they will be redirected
here.
- **Auth URL** - This is where your authentication pages are hosted, and you
will need this for the setup step.

## Installation

In your Next.js app, install the **@propelauth/react** library.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    $ npm install --save @propelauth/react
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    $ yarn add @propelauth/react
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Set up AuthProvider

**AuthProvider** is the provider of a
[React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) that manages the current
user's [access token](/overview/access-tokens) and metadata. You
cannot use the other hooks without it. **AuthProvider** manages authentication
information and all other components fetches from it.

It is recommended to put the **AuthProvider** context at the top level of your
application, so it never unmounts.

You should place it in **pages/\_app.jsx** or **pages/\_app.tsx**:

```jsx
import { AuthProvider } from "@propelauth/react";

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return (
    <AuthProvider authUrl={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
};

export default MyApp;
```

The authUrl is the base URL where your authentication pages are hosted. You can find this under the Frontend Integration section for your project.

### RequiredAuthProvider

If your entire application requires a user to be logged in, you can instead use
**RequiredAuthProvider**.

```jsx
import { RequiredAuthProvider, RedirectToLogin } from "@propelauth/react";

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return (
    <RequiredAuthProvider
        authUrl={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL}
        displayWhileLoading={<Loading />}
        displayIfLoggedOut={<RedirectToLogin />}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </RequiredAuthProvider>
  );
};

export default MyApp;
```

RequiredAuthProvider has two additional props:

1. **displayWhileLoading**: A React element to display while the AuthProvider is
fetching auth information. Defaults to an empty element
2. **displayIfLoggedOut**: A React eleent to display if the current user is
logged out. Defaults to [RedirectToLogin](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs#redirect-to-login)

## Get current user information

There are three options for getting the current user's information.

### withAuthInfo

`withAuthInfo` wraps a component and automatically adds auth information to the props of the component.

<CodeGroup>

```jsx Type
withAuthInfo(Component, {
    // A React element to display while the AuthProvider is fetching auth information. Defaults to an empty element
    displayWhileLoading: <div>Loading...</div>,
});
```

```jsx Example Usage
import { withAuthInfo } from "@propelauth/react";

function MinimalExample(props) {
    // isLoggedIn and user are injected automatically from withAuthInfo below
    if (props.isLoggedIn) {
        return <div>You are logged in as {props.user.email}</div>;
    } else {
        return <div>You are not logged in</div>;
    }
}

// withAuthInfo is a React Higher-Order Component that provides common values like isLoggedIn and accessToken.
// These values are injected into the props of your component.
export default withAuthInfo(MinimalExample);
```

</CodeGroup>

The following props are injected to the underlying component:

| Prop                                                   | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [accessToken](/overview/access-tokens)    | If user is logged in, this string can be passed in and validated by your backend. Otherwise, null. |
| isLoggedIn                                             | Returns user logged in status                                                                  |
| [orgHelper](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs#orghelper)       | A class with useful functions for managing organizations                                     |
| [accessHelper](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs#accesshelper) | A class with useful functions for accessing role and permissions (RBAC)                      |
| [user](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs#the-user-object)      | If user is logged in, this contains metadata about them. Otherwise, null                       |

### withRequiredAuthInfo

This is identical to withAuthInfo, except Component is only rendered if the user
is logged in. You are guaranteed that isLoggedIn is true and the accessToken is
not null.

<CodeGroup>

```jsx Type
withRequiredAuthInfo(Component, {
    // A React element to display while the AuthProvider is fetching auth information. Defaults to an empty element
    displayWhileLoading: <div>Loading...</div>,
    // A React element to display if the current user is logged out. Defaults to <RedirectToLogin />
    displayIfLoggedOut: <div>You are logged out</div>,
});
```

```jsx Example Usage
import { withRequiredAuthInfo } from "@propelauth/react";

function MinimalExample(props) {
    // user is injected automatically from withRequiredAuthInfo below
    return <div>You are logged in as {props.user.email}</div>;
}

// withRequiredAuthInfo is a React Higher-Order Component that provides common values like isLoggedIn and accessToken.
// These values are injected into the props of your component.
// Unlike withAuthInfo, withRequiredAuthInfo will make sure the user is logged in
export default withRequiredAuthInfo(MinimalExample);
```

</CodeGroup>

### useAuthInfo

```jsx
import { useAuthInfo } from "@propelauth/react";

function MinimalExample() {
  const authInfo = useAuthInfo();

  // Unlike the higher order functions, we need to check the loading case now
  if (authInfo.loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  } else if (authInfo.isLoggedIn) {
    return <div>You are logged in as {props.user.email}</div>;
  } else {
    return <div>You are not logged in</div>;
  }
}

export default MinimalExample;
```

A [React hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) which gets auth
information. authInfo contains:

| Key                                                    | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| loading                                                | True if the AuthProvider is still fetching auth information. This will only happen once when the application is first loaded. |
| [accessToken](/overview/access-tokens)    | If user is logged in, this string can be passed in and validated by your backend. Otherwise, null. |
| isLoggedIn                                             | Returns user logged in status                                                                  |
| [orgHelper](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs#orghelper)       | A class with useful functions for managing organizations                                     |
| [accessHelper](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs#accesshelper) | A class with useful functions for accessing role and permissions (RBAC)                      |
| [user](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs#the-user-object)      | If user is logged in, this contains metadata about them. Otherwise, null                       |

<Note>
    **When is an external API call made?**

    The AuthProvider context manages all external API requests. The functions
    withAuthInfo, withRequiredAuthInfo, and useAuthInfo only extract information
    from requests without making their own requests. For this reason, you can (and
    should) add as many of these functions as you need.
</Note>

## Other utilities

- [useLogoutFunction](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs#logout) - Returns a function for logging out the current user.

- [useRedirectFunctions](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs#use-redirect-functions) - Returns a set of functions to redirect the user to
different pages (e.g. signup, login).

For a complete list of utilities, see the
[Next.js Library Reference](/reference/frontend-apis/nextjs).

### Organizations

The **orgHelper**, provided by **withAuthInfo**, **withRequiredAuthInfo**, or
**useAuthInfo**, helps manage the current user's organization information with
ease. It's an object which has the following functions (types included):

```ts
type OrgHelper = {
    // returns all orgs that the user is a member of
    getOrgs: () => OrgMemberInfo[],
    // returns all org ids that the user is a member of
    getOrgIds: () => string[],
    // returns org information for a given orgId
    getOrg: (orgId: string) => OrgMemberInfo | undefined,
    // returns org information for a given org by name
    getOrgByName: (orgName: string) => OrgMemberInfo | undefined,
}

type OrgMemberInfo = {
    orgId: string,
    orgName: string,
    urlSafeOrgName: string
    // The role of the user within this organization
    userAssignedRole: string
    userPermissions: string[]
}
```

## Roles and Permissions

Your users will have a role in an organization. By default, these roles are
Owner, Admin, and Member - but you can configure them. Each role can have
permissions associated with them. See
[roles and permissions](/overview/roles) for more details.

The **accessHelper**, provided by **withAuthInfo**, **withRequiredAuthInfo**, or
**useAuthInfo**, helps check the current user's role and permission(s) within a
specific organization.

```ts
type AccessHelper = {
    isRole: (orgId: string, role: string) => boolean
    isAtLeastRole: (orgId: string, role: string) => boolean
    hasPermission: (orgId: string, permission: string) => boolean
    hasAllPermissions: (orgId: string, permissions: string[]) => boolean
}
```

## Active Organization

Since users can be in more than one organization, one common use case is to pick
a single organization that your user is currently operating within.

Commonly, developers use localStorage, a path parameter, or subdomain (e.g.
https://CUSTOMER.yourproduct.com or https://app.yourproduct.com/CUSTOMER) to
indicate which organization the user is currently operating within.

The **AuthProvider** and **RequiredAuthProvider** optionally take in a
**getActiveOrgFn** which enables you to select the currently active
organization, like so:

```jsx
// Get the active org from a path parameter grabbed from our router
<AuthProvider authUrl={AUTH_URL} getActiveOrgFn={() => router.query.orgName}>
```

**useActiveOrg** allows you to fetch the active organization later on. It will
also verify that the current user is actually in that organization.

```jsx
function OrgName() {
  const org = useActiveOrg();
  return <div>{org.orgName}</div>;
}
```

## Making an authenticated HTTP request

For authenticated requests on behalf of your user, you must provide an access
token. There are many of ways to make HTTP requests in Javascript. You could use
the
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch),
[XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest),
or a library like [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

Just like isLoggedIn and user, the access token is available from `withAuthInfo`, `withRequiredAuthInfo`, or `useAuthInfo`.
You provide it in the request in the `Authorization` header, like so:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Code sample of the Authorization with the Fetch API:

```js
function whoAmI(accessToken) {
  return fetch("/whoami", {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
  });
}
```
