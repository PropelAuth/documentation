For example:

- Passwordless logins
- Reset password emails
- Organization invitations

These emails will share the same color scheme and style you configure for your
hosted authentication pages. We manage these emails for you by default, so you don't need
to connect an external provider until you're ready.

## Sending Emails From Your Domain

By default, transactional emails will be sent from welcome@propelauth.dev; however, 
you can set up your projects to send emails from a custom email address and domain, 
which can help with email deliverability.

First, go to project settings. If you haven't [created a verified production domain](/getting-started/deploy-to-prod), 
you will see a link to the Go Live portion of your dashboard in the Send Emails 
From Your Domain section.

Once you have a verified production domain, click the Configure button.

Fill out your desired Sender Name and email address in the following modal. 
The Reply-To email will default to the same address as the From email, but this 
can be overwritten if desired. One thing to note: your email domains must match 
the verified production domain you set up in the Go Live section of your dashboard.

Once you have customized your email domains and hit Save, you will be returned to 
the dashboard's Project Settings section. Here, click the Verify DNS Records button.

Use the values in the modal that appears here in the DNS Server of your choice. 
Instructions for how to do this will vary depending on where you purchased the 
domain from. If you need any help, please reach out to us atÂ support@propelauth.com. 
It may take a few minutes for the DNS records to be set and verified.

Once your domain has been verified, emails will now be sent from the domains you 
specified. If you would like to change these emails in the future, you just need 
to update the email configuration in Project Settings, and verify once again with 
your DNS service.
