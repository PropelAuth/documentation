Start by going to the **Go Live** section of your project.

### Verify your domain

In your test environment, you use a subdomain of `https://propelauthtest.com` to
log in. In production, however, it's more natural to your users if they use
`https://auth.yourdomain.com`.

To set this up, you need to set up two DNS records:

- A **TXT** record with a unique verification code. This proves to us that you
  are the owner of the domain.
- A **CNAME** record redirecting traffic from auth.yourdomain.com to PropelAuth,
  so we can handle authentication on your behalf.

After entering your domain in the **Go Live section**, you'll be provided with
the exact DNS records to set.

Instructions for how to do this will vary depending on where you purchased the
domain from. If you need any help, please reach out to us at
support@propelauth.com. It may take a few minutes for the DNS records to be set.

### Updating your configurations

It's important to keep your test and production environments separate. For that
reason, the API keys that you used when you were testing only work in your test
environment. This also applies to your authUrl, which should be
`https://auth.yourdomain.com` in production.

Make sure to double check that when you deploy to production, you are using the
production values for your API keys and authUrl. Additionally, if you set up any
social logins, you'll want to make sure you add your production redirect URIs to
the providers.

### You are live

Congrats!
