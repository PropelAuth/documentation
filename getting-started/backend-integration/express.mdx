## Quick example

The following example creates a route which can only be accessed from logged-in users.

```js
const propelAuth = require("@propelauth/express");
const { requireUser } = propelAuth.initAuth({
  // You can find your Auth URL and API key under the Backend Integration
  //   section for your project at https://app.propelauth.com.
  authUrl: "YOUR_AUTH_URL",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

// requireUser is a middleware which validates the access token
app.get("/hello", requireUser, (req, res) => {
  res.text("Hello user with ID " + req.user.userId);
});
```

## How it works

For a detailed description of what's going on under the hood, see [here](/overview/how-our-auth-works).

## Installation

In your Express app, install the @propelauth/express library.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
$ npm install --save @propelauth/express
```

```bash yarn
$ yarn add @propelauth/express
```

</CodeGroup>

## Initialize

initAuth performs a one-time initialization of the library. It will verify your
`apiKey` is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access tokens in
[requireUser](#require-user), [optionalUser](#optional-user), or [requireOrgMember](#require-org-member).

We recommend calling this in a new file and exporting the result.

```js
// propelauth.js
const propelAuth = require("@propelauth/express");
module.exports = propelAuth.initAuth({
  // If true, error messages returned to the user will be detailed.
  // It's useful for debugging, but a good idea to turn off in production.
  debugMode: true,
  // You can find your Auth URL and API key under the Backend Integration
  //   section for your project at https://app.propelauth.com.
  authUrl: "https://auth.yourdomain.com",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});
```

And then importing just what you need:

```js
const { requireUser } = require("./propelauth");
```

## Protect API routes

### requireUser

An Express middleware that will verify the request was made by a valid user.
Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set **user** on the **Request** with the user's information.

```js
app.get("/hello", requireUser, (req, res) => {
  res.text("Hello user with ID " + req.user.userId);
});
```

The **user** object looks like:

| Property             | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| userId               | The id of the user                                                                       |
| orgIdToOrgMemberInfo | A dictionary of org ids to metadata about the org. Includes all orgs that the user is in |
| legacyUserId         | The original ID of the user, if the user was migrated from an external source            |

The values of **orgIdToOrgMemberInfo** are **OrgMemberInfo**'s, with the
following fields/functions:

| Field | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| orgId                                             | The id of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| orgName                                           | The name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| urlSafeOrgName                                    | A URL-safe version of the name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| assignedRole(): string                            | The user's role within the organization. See [Roles and Permissions](/overview/roles) for more details.                                                                                                               |
| permissions(): string[]                           | The user's permissions within the organization. See [Roles and Permissions](/overview/roles)                                                                                                                          |
| isRole(role: string): boolean                     | Returns True if the user's role within the organization matches the `role` passed in                                                                                                                                               |
| isAtLeastRole(role: string): boolean              | Returns True if the user's role within the organization is at least the `role` passed in. If the hierarchy of roles is Owner => Admin => Member, specifying "Admin" will return True for Admins and Owners, but False for Members. |
| hasPermission(permission: string): boolean        | Returns True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |
| hasAllPermissions(permissions: string[]): boolean | Returns True if the user has all the specified permissions. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                            |

### optionalUser

Similar to
[requireUser](#require-user), except
if an access token is missing or invalid, the request is allowed to continue,
but **user** on the **Request** will be **undefined**.

```js
app.get("/hello", optionalUser, (req, res) => {
  if (req.user) {
    res.text("Hello user with ID " + req.user.userId);
  } else {
    res.text("Hello anonymous");
  }
});
```

### requireOrgMember

An Express middleware that will verify the request was made by a valid user that
belongs to a specific organization.

<CodeGroup>

```js Basic example
// By default, requireOrgMember checks for orgId as a path parameter
app.get("/org/:orgId/hello", requireOrgMember(), (req, res) => {
  res.text("You are in " + req.org.orgName);
});
```

```js Advanced example
// Expect users to query with /hello?orgId=...
const orgIdInQueryExtractor = (req) => req.query.orgId;
const requireOrgInQuery = requireOrgMember({
  orgIdExtractor: orgIdInQueryExtractor,
});

app.get("/hello", requireOrgInQuery, (req, res) => {
  res.text("You are in " + req.org.orgName);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set **user** on the **Request** with the user's information. See [requireUser](#require-user)
   for what the **user** object looks like.
3. Find an id for an organization within the request. By default, it will check
   **Request.params.orgId** (a path parameter named **orgId**).
4. Check that the user is a member of that organization. If not, the request is
   rejected with a `403` status code.
5. Set **org** on the **Request** with the organization's information for this
   user.

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles
are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured. These roles
are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If
you want to check a user's role, you can use `requireOrgMemberWithExactRole` or
`requireOrgMemberWithMinimumRole`.

```js
// Assuming a Role structure of Owner => Admin => Member

app.get(
  "/org/:orgId/admin",
  requireOrgMemberWithExactRole({ role: "Admin" }),
  (req, res) => {
    res.text("You are an Admin of " + req.org.orgName);
  }
);

app.get(
  "/org/:orgId/admin_or_owner",
  requireOrgMemberWithMinimumRole({ minimumRequiredRole: "Admin" }),
  (req, res) => {
    res.text("You are an Admin of " + req.org.orgName);
  }
);
```

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
**can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**, and **ReadOnly** are all valid
permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **requireOrgMemberWithPermission** or
**requireOrgMemberWithAllPermissions** to check for a given permission.

```js
app.get(
  "/org/:orgId/billing",
  requireOrgMemberWithPermission({ permission: "can_view_billing" }),
  (req, res) => {
    // TODO: view billing
  }
);
```

All of these functions, just like [requireOrgMember](#require-org-member), can also take in
**orgIdExtractor**, and will set both **req.user** and **req.org** on a valid
request.

## API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

```js
// Example
const usersResponse = await fetchUsersByQuery({
  emailOrUsername: "@example.com",
  orderBy: "LAST_ACTIVE_AT_DESC",
});
for (const user of userResponse.users) {
  console.log("Found user " + user);
}
```

See [Express Library Reference](/reference/backend-apis/express) for more information
on available functionality.
