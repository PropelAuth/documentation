### Quick example

The following example validates an Authorization HTTP header was sent from a
logged-in user.

```js
import {handleError, initAuth} from '@propelauth/cloudflare-worker'

const {validateAuthHeaderAndGetUser} = initAuth({
  // The base URL where your authentication pages are hosted.
  // You can find your Auth URL under the Backend Integration section for your project at https://app.propelauth.com.
  authUrl: "YOUR_AUTH_URL",
  // You can manage your api keys under the Backend Integration section for your project.
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  // This can also be found under the Backend Integration section
  verifierKey: `YOUR
MULTILINE
KEY`
});

export default {
	async fetch(
		request: Request,
		env: Env,
		ctx: ExecutionContext
	): Promise<Response> {
		try {
			const user = await validateAuthHeaderAndGetUser(request.headers.get("authorization"))
		    return Response.json(user)
		} catch (e) {
			const error = handleError(e, {logError: true, returnDetailedErrorToUser: true})
			return new Response(error.message, {status: error.status})
		}
	},
};
```

### How it works

The front-end receives an [access token](/overview-and-concpets/access-tokens).
This access token is provided in an Authorization header when an HTTP request is
made.

PropelAuth provides you with metadata that you use to validate the access token
and figure out who it belongs to. The complexity of
validating the tokens is hidden in validation functions in this library.

## Installation

In your Cloudflare workers project, install the **@propelauth/cloudflare-worker** library.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
$ npm install --save @propelauth/cloudflare-worker
```

```bash yarn
$ yarn add @propelauth/cloudflare-worker
```

</CodeGroup>

## Initialize

To initialize the library, call `initAuth`. You can either do this in a separate file and export it, or in your worker directly.

```js
import {initAuth} from '@propelauth/cloudflare-worker'

const auth = initAuth({
  // The base URL where your authentication pages are hosted.
  // You can find your Auth URL under the Backend Integration section for your project at https://app.propelauth.com.
  authUrl: "YOUR_AUTH_URL",
  // You can manage your api keys under the Backend Integration section for your project.
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  // This can also be found under the Backend Integration section
  verifierKey: `YOUR
MULTILINE
KEY`
});
```

### Protect API routes

#### validateAuthHeaderAndGetUser

This function takes in the `Authorization` HTTP header and verifies the request
was made by a valid user. It expects the header to be in the format
`Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`. If the Authorization HTTP header is malformed or doesn't
contain a valid [access token](/overview/access-tokens), an
`UnauthorizedException` is thrown.

```js
let user;
try {
    user = await validateAuthHeaderAndGetUser(request.headers.get("authorization"))
} catch (e) {
    const error = handleError(e, {logError: true, returnDetailedErrorToUser: true})
    return new Response(error.message, {status: error.status})
}
```

The **user** object looks like:

| Property             | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| userId               | The id of the user                                                                       |
| orgIdToOrgMemberInfo | A dictionary of org ids to metadata about the org. Includes all orgs that the user is in |
| legacyUserId         | The original ID of the user, if the user was migrated from an external source            |

The values of **orgIdToOrgMemberInfo** are **OrgMemberInfo**'s, with the
following fields/functions:

| OrgMemberInfo                                     | fields/properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Description |

| org_name                                          | The name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| urlSafeOrgName                                    | A URL-safe version of the name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| assignedRole(): string                            | The user's role within the organization. See [Roles and Permissions](/overview/roles) for more details.                                                                                                               |

| isRole(role: string): boolean                     | Returns True if the user's role within the organization matches the `role` passed in                                                                                                                                               |
| isAtLeastRole(role: string): boolean              | Returns True if the user's role within the organization is at least the `role` passed in. If the hierarchy of roles is Owner => Admin => Member, specifying "Admin" will return True for Admins and Owners, but False for Members. |
| hasPermission(permission: string): boolean        | Return True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |
| hasAllPermissions(permissions: string[]): boolean | Return True if the user has all the specified permissions. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                            |

### validateAuthHeaderAndGetUserWithOrgInfo

This function will verify that a request was made by a valid user AND that user
is in an organization.

| Argument                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization HTTP Header | It expects the header to be in the format `Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`. If the `Authorization` HTTP header is malformed or doesn't contain a valid access token, an `UnauthorizedException` is thrown.                                                                                        |
| Required Org Info         | An object with optional fields `orgId` and `orgName`. This function will make sure the user who made the request is a member of an organization with the specified `orgId` and `orgName`. If the user is NOT a member of the specified organization, a `ForbiddenException` is thrown. |

It returns an object with two fields:

```js
{
    user: //...
    orgMemberInfo: //...
}
```

You can see the structure of the `user` and `orgMemberInfo` objects above.

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles
are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured. These
roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If
you want to check a user's role, you can use
**validateAuthHeaderAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithExactRole** or
**validateAuthHeaderAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithMinimumRole**.

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
**can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**, and **ReadOnly** are all valid
permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **validateAuthHeaderAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithPermission** or
**validateAuthHeaderAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithAllPermissions** to check for a given permission.

## API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

```js
// Example
const usersResponse = await auth.fetchUsersByQuery({
  emailOrUsername: "@example.com",
  orderBy: "LAST_ACTIVE_AT_DESC",
});
for (const user of userResponse.users) {
  console.log("Found user " + user);
}
```

See [Library Reference](/reference/backend-apis/cloudflare) for more information on
available functionality.
