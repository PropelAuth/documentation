  "PropelAuth offers an end-to-end managed user authentication library for
  seamless integration into your Next.js application. This guide will show you
  how to connect the PropelAuth library to your API using Next.js."
---

For the full Next.js Library Reference, click [here](/reference/backend/nextjs).

## What are API Routes?

API routes provide a solution to build your API with Next.js.

Any file inside the folder `pages/api` is mapped to `/api/*` and will be treated
as an API endpoint instead of a page. They are server-side only bundles and
won't increase your client-side bundle size.

What's great is that these APIs can be completely managed by services like
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/). As a result of PropelAuth's middleware, it is
possible to determine whether a user is logged in on the fly, with no need to go
to a database.

Next.js API routes support **express** compatible middleware, so we will use the
**@propelauth/express** library.

## How it works

PropelAuth provides you with metadata that you use to validate the access token
and figure out who it belongs to. The complexity of fetching the metadata and
validating the tokens is hidden in the
[Next.js library](/reference/backend/nextjs).

The front-end receives an [access token](/overview-and-concpets/access-tokens).
This access token is provided in an Authorization header when an HTTP request is
made.

## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
$ npm install --save @propelauth/express
```

```bash yarn
$ yarn add @propelauth/express
```

</CodeGroup>

## Initialize

To initialize the PropelAuth library in `lib/propelauth.js`, enter the code
below:

```js
import { initAuth } from "@propelauth/express";

const propelauth = initAuth({
  debugMode: true, // If true, error messages returned to the user will be detailed. It's useful for debugging, but a good idea to turn off in production.
  authUrl: "YOUR_AUTH_URL", // The base URL where your authentication pages are hosted. You can find your Auth URL under the Backend Integration section for your project at https://app.propelauth.com.
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // You can manage your api keys under the Backend Integration section for your project.
  manualTokenVerificationMetadata: {
    verifierKey: "YOUR_VERIFER_KEY", // You can find your Verifier Key under the Backend Integration section for your project at https://app.propelauth.com.
    issuer: "YOUR_ISSUER_URL", // You can find your issuer URL under the Backend Integration section for your project at https://app.propelauth.com.
  },
});
```

You can then import what you need from **propelauth** in your routes:

```js
import { requireUser, requireOrgMember } from "../../lib/propelauth";
```

## Running middleware in a NextJS API route

The full details are available in the
[official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/request-helpers#connectexpress-middleware-support).

Nevertheless, an important thing to know is that you can create this helper
function:

```js
// Helper method to wait for a middleware to execute before continuing
// And to throw an error when an error happens in a middleware
export function runMiddleware(req, res, fn) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fn(req, res, (result) => {
      if (result instanceof Error) {
        return reject(result);
      }

      return resolve(result);
    });
  });
}
```

Now you can use the `runMiddleware` helper function to call middleware within
your routes as shown in the code below:

```js
async function handler(req, res) {
  // Run the middleware
  await runMiddleware(req, res, YOUR_MIDDLEWARE);

  // Rest of the API logic
  res.json({ message: "Hello Everyone!" });
}
```

## Protect API routes

### requireUser

An Express middleware that will verify the request was made by a valid user.
Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set **user** on the **Request** with the user's information.

```js
import { requireUser } from "../../lib/propelauth";

async function handler(req, res) {
  // Verifies that a request was made with a valid access token
  await runMiddleware(req, res, requireUser);

  // req.user is now set from our requireUser middleware
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello user with ID " + req.user.userId });
}
```

The **user** object looks like:

| Property             | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| userId               | The id of the user                                                                       |
| orgIdToOrgMemberInfo | A dictionary of org ids to metadata about the org. Includes all orgs that the user is in |
| legacyUserId         | The original ID of the user, if the user was migrated from an external source            |

The values of **orgIdToOrgMemberInfo** are **OrgMemberInfo**'s, with the
following fields/functions:

| OrgMemberInfo                                     | fields/properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| org_id                                            | The id of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| org_name                                          | The name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| urlSafeOrgName                                    | A URL-safe version of the name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| assignedRole(): string                            | The user's role within the organization. See [Roles and Permissions](/overview/roles) for more details.                                                                                                               |
| permissions(): string[]                           | The user's permissions within the organization. See [Roles and Permissions](/overview/roles)                                                                                                                          |
| isRole(role: string): boolean                     | Returns True if the user's role within the organization matches the `role` passed in                                                                                                                                               |
| isAtLeastRole(role: string): boolean              | Returns True if the user's role within the organization is at least the `role` passed in. If the hierarchy of roles is Owner => Admin => Member, specifying "Admin" will return True for Admins and Owners, but False for Members. |
| hasPermission(permission: string): boolean        | Return True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |
| hasAllPermissions(permissions: string[]): boolean | Return True if the user has all the specified permissions. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                            |

### optionalUser

Similar to
[requireUser](/getting-started/backend-integration/nextjs/#require-user), except
if an access token is missing or invalid, the request is allowed to continue,
but **user** on the **Request** will be **undefined**.

```js
import { optionalUser } from "../../lib/propelauth";

async function handler(req, res) {
  await runMiddleware(req, res, optionalUser);

  if (req.user) {
    res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello user with ID " + req.user.userId });
  } else {
    res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello anonymous" });
  }
}
```

### requireOrgMember

An Express middleware that will verify the request was made by a valid user that
belongs to a specific organization.

```js
import { requireOrgMember } from "../../lib/propelauth";

const requireUserInOrgByQueryParam = requireOrgMember({
  // Tell our middleware that the orgId comes from `req.query`
  orgIdExtractor: (req) => req.query.orgId,
});

async function handler(req, res) {
  await runMiddleware(req, res, requireUserInOrgByQueryParam);

  // requireAdminInOrg automatically sets req.org
  res.status(200).json({ message: "You are in " + req.org.orgName });
}
```

| Argument        | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| current_user    | The result of require_user                                                                                                                                                      |
| required_org_id | The id of an organization. This function will check that the current user is a member of this org. Typically, this is passed in from the frontend as a query or path parameter. |

Specifically, it will:

```js
import { requireOrgMember } from "../../lib/propelauth";

const requireUserInOrgByQueryParam = requireOrgMember({
  // Tell our middleware that the orgId comes from `req.query`
  orgIdExtractor: (req) => req.query.orgId,
});

async function handler(req, res) {
  await runMiddleware(req, res, requireUserInOrgByQueryParam);

  // requireAdminInOrg automatically sets req.org
  res.status(200).json({ message: "You are in " + req.org.orgName });
}
```

Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set **user** on the **Request** with the user's information. See
   [requireUser](/getting-started/backend-integration/nextjs#require-user) for
   what the **user** object looks like.
3. Find an **id** for an organization within the request. By default, it will
   check **Request.params.orgId** (a path parameter named **orgId**).
4. Check that the user is a member of that organization. If not, the request is
   rejected with a `403` status code.
5. Set **org** on the **Request** with the organization's information for this
   user.

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles
are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured. These
roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If
you want to check a user's role, you can use `requireOrgMemberWithExactRole` or
`requireOrgMemberWithMinimumRole`.

<CodeGroup>

```js requireOrgMemberWithExactRole
// Assuming a Role structure of Owner => Admin => Member
async function handler(req, res) {
  await runMiddleware(
    req,
    res,
    requireOrgMemberWithExactRole({ role: "Admin" })
  );

  res
    .status(200)
    .json({ message: "You are in an Admin of " + req.org.orgName });
}
```

```js requireOrgMemberWithMinimumRole
async function handler(req, res) {
  await runMiddleware(
    req,
    res,
    requireOrgMemberWithMinimumRole({ minimumRequiredRole: "Admin" })
  );

  res
    .status(200)
    .json({ message: "You are in an Admin or Owner of " + req.org.orgName });
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
**can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**, and **ReadOnly** are all valid
permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **requireOrgMemberWithPermission** or
**requireOrgMemberWithAllPermissions** to check for a given permission.

```js
async function handler(req, res) {
  await runMiddleware(
    req,
    res,
    requireOrgMemberWithPermission({ permission: "can_view_billing" })
  );

  // view billing
}
```

All of these functions, just like **requireOrgMember**, can also take in
**orgIdExtractor**, and will set both **req.user** and **req.org** on a valid
request.

## API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

```js
// Example
const usersResponse = await fetchUsersByQuery({
  emailOrUsername: "@example.com",
  orderBy: "LAST_ACTIVE_AT_DESC",
});
for (const user of userResponse.users) {
  console.log("Found user " + user);
}
```

See [Next.js Library Reference](/reference/backend/next.js) for more information
on available functionality.
