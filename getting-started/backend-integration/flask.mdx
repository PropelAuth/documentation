desciption:
  "PropelAuth offers an end-to-end managed user authentication library for
  seamless integration into your Flask application. This guide will show you how
  to connect the PropelAuth library to your backend."
---

For the full Flask Library Reference, click [here](/reference/backend/flask).

### Quick Example

The following example creates a route which can only be accessed from logged-in
users.

```js
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", #
                 "YOUR_API_KEY") #

@app.route("/api/whoami")
@auth.require_user
def who_am_i():
    return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
```

### How it works

The front-end receives an [access token](/overview/access-tokens).
This access token is provided in an `Authorization` header when an HTTP request
is made.

PropelAuth provides you with metadata that you use to validate the access token
and figure out who it belongs to. The complexity of fetching the metadata and
validating the tokens is hidden in the
[Flask library](/reference/backend/flask).

### Installation

In your Flask app, install the **propelauth_flask** library.

```bash
$ pip install propelauth-flask
```

### Initialize

**init_auth** performs a one-time initialization of the library. It will verify
your `api_key` is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access tokens
in
[IsUserAuthenticated](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#is-user-authenticated),
[AllowAny](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#allow-any), and
[IsUserInOrg](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#is-user-in-org).

```js
from propelauth_flask import init_auth

auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", #
                 "YOUR_API_KEY") #
```

### Protect API routes

#### require_user

A decorator that will verify the request was made by a valid user. Specifically,
it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set **current_user** (scoped to the current request) with the user's
   information.

```js
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@app.route("/api/whoami")
@auth.require_user
def who_am_i():
    """This route is protected, current_user is always set"""
    return {"user_id": current_user.user_id} #
```

#### optional_user

Similar to
[IsUserAuthenticated](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#is-user-authenticated),
except if an access token is missing or invalid, the request is allowed to
continue, but `current_user.exists()` will be `False`.

```js
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@app.route("/api/whoami_optional")
@auth.optional_user
def who_am_i_optional():
    if current_user.exists(): #
        return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
    return {}
```

#### current-user

A per-request value that contains user information for the user making the
request. It's set by one of
[IsUserAuthenticated](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#is-user-authenticated),
[AllowAny](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#allow-any), or any
organization checking like
[IsUserInOrg](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#is-user-in-org).

| user_has_permission(permission: str): bool             | Return True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |

#### require_ord_member

A decorator that will verify the request was made by a valid user that belongs
to a specific organization.

<CodeGroup>

```js Basic example
@app.route("/org/<org_id>/check")
@auth.require_org_member()
def hello(org_id):
   return f"You are in {current_org.org_name}"
```

```js Advanced example
# Expect users to query with /hello?org_id=...
def org_id_in_query_extractor(req):
   return req.args.get('org_id')

@app.route("/hello")
@auth.require_org_member(req_to_org_id=org_id_in_query_extractor)
def hello():
    return f"You are in {current_org.org_name}"
```

</CodeGroup>

| IsUserInOrg Argument | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| req_to_org_id        | A function that takes in the request and outputs the org_id to require the user to be a member of. If none is specified, it will check for a path param org_id by checking request.GET.get('org_id', ''). |

Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set [current-user](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#current-user)
   with the user's information.
3. Find an id for an organization within the request. By default, it will check
   for a path parameter **org_id**.
4. Check that the user is a member of that organization. If not, the request is
   rejected with a `403` status code.
5. Set [current-user](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#current-user)
   (scoped to the current request) with the organization's information for this
   user.

### Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles
are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured. These
roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If
you want to check a user's role, you can use **auth.IsUserInOrgWithRole** or
**auth.IsUserInOrgWithMinimumRole**.

```js
## Assuming a Role structure of Owner => Admin => Member

@app.route("/org/<org_id>/admin")
@auth.require_org_member_with_exact_role("Admin")
def admin(org_id):
   return f"You are an Admin of {current_org.org_name}"

@app.route("/org/<org_id>/admin_or_owner")
@auth.require_org_member_with_minimum_role("Admin")
def admin_or_owner(org_id):
   return f"You are an Admin or Owner of {current_org.org_name}"
```

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
**can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**, and **ReadOnly** are all valid
permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **auth.IsUserInOrgWithPermission** or
**auth.IsUserInOrgWithAllPermissions** to check for a given permission.

```
@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([auth.IsUserInOrgWithPermission("can_view_billing")])
def billing_req(request):
   pass
```

All of these functions, just like IsUserInOrg, will also take in
**req_to_org_id**, and will set both
[current-user](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#current-user) and
[current-org](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask/#current-org) on a valid
request.

#### current_org

A per-request value that contains org information for the user making the
request. It's set by **require_org_member**.

### API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

See [Flask Library Reference](/reference/backend/flask) for more information on
available functionality.

### Next Steps

Done with your backend? Next you can deploy to
[production](/getting-started/deploy-to-prod).
