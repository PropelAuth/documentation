For the full Flask Library Reference, click [here](/reference/backend-apis/flask).

## Quick Example

The following example creates a route which can only be accessed from logged-in users.

```python
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@app.route("/api/whoami")
@auth.require_user
def who_am_i():
    return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
```

You can find your Auth URL and API key(s) under the  **Backend Integration** section for your project at [https://app.propelauth.com](https://app.propelauth.com)

## How it works

For a detailed description of what's going on under the hood, see [here](/overview/how-our-auth-works).

## Installation

In your Flask app, install the **propelauth_flask** library.

```bash
$ pip install propelauth-flask
```

## Initialize

**init_auth** performs a one-time initialization of the library. It will verify your `api_key` is correct and fetch the
metadata needed to verify access tokens in [require_user](#require-user), [optional_user](#optional-user), or [require_org_member](#require-org-member).

```python
from propelauth_flask import init_auth

auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Protect API routes

### require_user

A decorator that will verify the request was made by a valid user. Specifically,
it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set [current_user](#current-user) (scoped to the current request) with the user's
   information.

```python
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@app.route("/api/whoami")
@auth.require_user
def who_am_i():
    """This route is protected, current_user is always set"""
    return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
```

### optional_user

Similar to [require_user](#require-user), except if an access token is missing or invalid, the request is allowed to
continue, but `current_user.exists()` will be `False`.

```python
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@app.route("/api/whoami_optional")
@auth.optional_user
def who_am_i_optional():
    if current_user.exists():
        return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
    return {}
```

### current_user

A per-request value that contains user information for the user making the request. It's set by one of
[require_user](#require-user), [optional_user](#optional-user), or [require_org_member](#require-org-member).

| Property                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| org_id_to_org_member_info | A dictionary of org ids to metadata about the org. Includes all orgs that the user is in                                                                                                                                            |
| legacy_user_id            | The original ID of the user, if the user was migrated from an external source                                                                                                                                                       |
| exists()                  | A function that returns True if the user is logged in and False otherwise. You only need to check this if you are using [optional_user](#optional-user), otherwise it always returns True. |

The values of `org_id_to_org_member_info` are `OrgMemberInfo`'s, with the
following fields/functions:

| Property | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| org_id                                                 | The id of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| user_is_at_least_role(role: str): bool                 | Returns True if the user's role within the organization is at least the `role` passed in. If the hierarchy of roles is Owner => Admin => Member, specifying "Admin" will return True for Admins and Owners, but False for Members. |
| user_has_permission(permission: str): bool             | Returns True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |

### require_org_member

A decorator that will verify the request was made by a valid user that belongs
to a specific organization.

<CodeGroup>

```python Basic example
@app.route("/org/<org_id>/check")
@auth.require_org_member()
def hello(org_id):
   return f"You are in {current_org.org_name}"
```

```python Advanced example
# Expect users to query with /hello?org_id=...
def org_id_in_query_extractor(req):
   return req.args.get('org_id')

@app.route("/hello")
@auth.require_org_member(req_to_org_id=org_id_in_query_extractor)
def hello():
    return f"You are in {current_org.org_name}"
```

</CodeGroup>

| require_org_member Argument | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| req_to_org_id               | A function that takes in the request and outputs the **org_id** to require the user to be a member of. If none is specified, it will check for a path param **org_id**.                                                |

Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set [current_user](#current-user) (scoped to the current request)
   with the user's information.
3. Find an id for an organization within the request. By default, it will check
   for a path parameter **org_id**.
4. Check that the user is a member of that organization. If not, the request is
   rejected with a `403` status code.
5. Set [current_org](#current-org)
   (scoped to the current request) with the organization's information for this
   user.

### current_org

A per-request value that contains org information for the user making the
request. It's set by [require_org_member](#require-org-member).

| Property                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| user_is_role(role: str): bool                          | Returns True if the user's role within the organization matches the `role` passed in                                                                                                                                               |
| user_is_at_least_role(role: str): bool                 | Returns True if the user's role within the organization is at least the `role` passed in. If the hierarchy of roles is Owner => Admin => Member, specifying "Admin" will return True for Admins and Owners, but False for Members. |
| user_has_permission(permission: str): bool             | Return True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |
| user_has_all_permissions(permissions: List[str]): bool | Return True if the user has all the specified permissions. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                            |

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured.
These roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If you want to check a user's role, you can use **auth.require_org_member_with_exact_role** or **auth.require_org_member_with_minimum_role**.

```python
## Assuming a Role structure of Owner => Admin => Member

@app.route("/org/<org_id>/admin")
@auth.require_org_member_with_exact_role("Admin")
def admin(org_id):
   return f"You are an Admin of {current_org.org_name}"

@app.route("/org/<org_id>/admin_or_owner")
@auth.require_org_member_with_minimum_role("Admin")
def admin_or_owner(org_id):
   return f"You are an Admin or Owner of {current_org.org_name}"
```

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example, **can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**,
and **ReadOnly** are all valid permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **auth.require_org_member_with_permission** or **auth.require_org_member_with_all_permissions** to check for a given permission.

```python
@app.route("/org/<org_id>/billing")
@auth.require_org_member_with_permission("can_view_billing")
def billing(org_id):
   pass
```

All of these functions, just like [require_org_member](#require-org-member),
will also take in **req_to_org_id**, and will set both [current_user](#current-user) and [current_org](#current-org) on a valid request.

## API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

See [Flask Library Reference](/reference/backend-apis/flask) for more information on
available functionality.
