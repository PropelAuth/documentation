For the full Django Rest Framework Library Reference, click
[here](/reference/backend-apis/django).

## Quick Example

The following example creates a view that logged-in users can only access. It’s
derived from Django Rest Framework’s
[tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/),
where the Snippet models and Serializers originated.

```python
from propelauth_django_rest_framework import init_auth
from rest_framework.decorators import action
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import permissions

auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

class SnippetViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer

    # This permission verifies the user is logged in and has passed in a valid access token
    #   it also sets request.propelauth_user, which you can see below
    permission_classes = [auth.IsUserAuthenticated]


    def perform_create(self, serializer):
        serializer.save(owner=self.request.propelauth_user.user_id)
```

You can find your Auth URL and API key(s) under the  **Backend Integration** section for your project at [https://app.propelauth.com](https://app.propelauth.com)

## How it works

For a detailed description of what's going on under the hood, see [here](/overview/how-our-auth-works).

## Installation

In your app, install the **propelauth-django-rest-framework** library.

```bash
$ pip install propelauth-django-rest-framework
```

## Initialize

**init_auth** performs a one-time initialization of the library. It will verify
your `api_key` is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access tokens
in
[IsUserAuthenticated](#is-user-authenticated), [AllowAny](#allow-any), and [IsUserInOrg](#is-user-in-org).

```python
from propelauth_django_rest_framework import init_auth

auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Protect API routes

### IsUserAuthenticated

A permission that will verify the request was made by a valid user.
Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set **request.propelauth_user** with the user's information.

```python
from propelauth_django_rest_framework import init_auth

auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([auth.IsUserAuthenticated])
def whoami(request):
   return HttpResponse(request.propelauth_user.user_id)
```

or you can use it in class-based views:

```python
class WhoAmIView(APIView):
   permission_classes = [auth.IsUserAuthenticated]

   def get(self, request):
      return HttpResponse(request.propelauth_user.user_id)
```

### AllowAny

Similar to [IsUserAuthenticated](#is-user-authenticated),
except if an access token is missing or invalid, the request is allowed to
continue, but `request.propelauth_user` will be `None`.

```python
class OptionalUserView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [auth.AllowAny]

    def get(self, request):
        if request.propelauth_user is None:
            return HttpResponse("none")
        return HttpResponse(request.propelauth_user.user_id)
```

### request.propelauth_user

A per-request value that contains user information for the user making the
request. It's set by one of [IsUserAuthenticated](#is-user-authenticated),
[AllowAny](#allow-any), or any organization checking like [IsUserInOrg](#is-user-in-org).

| Property                  | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user_id                   | The id of the user                                                                       |
| org_id_to_org_member_info | A dictionary of org ids to metadata about the org. Includes all orgs that the user is in |
| legacy_user_id            | The original ID of the user, if the user was migrated from an external source            |

The values of `org_id_to_org_member_info` are `OrgMemberInfo`'s, with the
following fields/functions:

| Field | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| org_name                                               | The name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| user_assigned_role                                     | The user's role within the organization. See [Roles and Permissions](/overview/roles) for more details.                                                                                                               |
| user_is_role(role: str): bool                          | Returns True if the user's role within the organization matches the `role` passed in                                                                                                                                               |
| user_is_at_least_role(role: str): bool                 | Returns True if the user's role within the organization is at least the `role` passed in. If the hierarchy of roles is Owner => Admin => Member, specifying "Admin" will return True for Admins and Owners, but False for Members. |
| user_has_permission(permission: str): bool             | Returns True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |

### IsUserInOrg

A function that returns a Django permission that will verify the request was
made by a valid user that belongs to a specific organization.

| IsUserInOrg Argument | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| req_to_org_id        | A function that takes in the request and outputs the org_id to require the user to be a member of. If none is specified, it will check for a path param org_id by checking `request.GET.get('org_id', '')`. |

```python
@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([auth.IsUserInOrg()])
def org_membership(request):
   message = f"You are in {request.propelauth_org.org_name}"
   return HttpResponse(message)
```

Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set
   [request.propelauth_user](/getting-started/backend-integration/django/#request-propelauth-user)
   with the user's information.
3. Find an id for an organization within the request. By default, it will check
   for a path parameter **org_id**.
4. Check that the user is a member of that organization. If not, the request is
   rejected with a `403` status code.
5. Set
   [request.propelauth_org](/getting-started/backend-integration/django/#request-propelauth-org)
   (scoped to the current request) with the organization's information for this
   user.

### request.propelauth_org

A per-request value that contains org information for the user making the
request.

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles
are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured. These
roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If
you want to check a user's role, you can use `auth.IsUserInOrgWithRole` or
`auth.IsUserInOrgWithMinimumRole`.

```python
## Assuming a Role structure of Owner => Admin => Member

@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([auth.IsUserInOrgWithRole("Admin")])
def admin_only(request):
   message = f"You are an Admin of {request.propelauth_org.org_name}"
   return HttpResponse(message)

@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([auth.IsUserInOrgWithMinimumRole("Admin")])
def admin_or_owner(request):
   message = f"You are an Admin or Owner of {request.propelauth_org.org_name}"
   return HttpResponse(message)
```

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
**can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**, and **ReadOnly** are all valid
permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **auth.IsUserInOrgWithPermission** or
**auth.IsUserInOrgWithAllPermissions** to check for a given permission.

```python
@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([auth.IsUserInOrgWithPermission("can_view_billing")])
def billing_req(request):
   pass
```

All of these functions, just like IsUserInOrg, will also take in
**req_to_org_id**, and will set both
[request.propelauth_user](/getting-started/backend-integration/django/#request-propelauth-user)
and
[request.propelauth_org](/getting-started/backend-integration/django/#request-propelauth-org)
on a valid request.

## API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

See [Django Rest Framework Library Reference](/reference/backend-apis/django) for
more information on available functionality.

## Next Steps

Done with your backend? Next you can deploy to
[production](/getting-started/deploy-to-prod).
