  "PropelAuth offers an end-to-end managed user authentication library for
  seamless integration into your FastAPI application. This guide will show you
  how to connect the PropelAuth library to your backend."
---

For the full FastAPI Library Reference, click
[here](/reference/backend/fastapi).

### Quick example

The following example creates a route which can only be accessed from logged-in
users.

```js
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from propelauth_fastapi import init_auth, User

app = FastAPI()
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", #
                 "YOUR_API_KEY") #

@app.get("/")
async def root(current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    return {"message": f"Hello {current_user.user_id}"}
```

### How it works

The front-end receives an [access token](/overview-and-concpets/access-tokens).
This access token is provided in an Authorization header when an HTTP request is
made.

PropelAuth provides you with metadata that you use to validate the access token
and figure out who it belongs to. The complexity of fetching the metadata and
validating the tokens is hidden in the
[FastApi library](/reference/backend/fastapi).

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install propelauth_fastapi
```

### Initialize

**initAuth** performs a one-time initialization of the library. It will verify
your `apiKey` is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access tokens
in [requireUser](/getting-started/backend-integration/fastapi/#require-user),
[optionalUser](/getting-started/backend-integration/fastapi/#optional-user), or
[requireOrgMember](/getting-started/backend-integration/fastapi/#require-org-member).

```js
from propelauth_fastapi import init_auth

auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", #
                 "YOUR_API_KEY") #
```

### Protect API routes

#### User

A user returned by
[require_user](/getting-started/backend-integration/fastapi/#require-user) or
[optional_user]().

| Property             | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| userId               | The id of the user                                                                       |
| orgIdToOrgMemberInfo | A dictionary of org ids to metadata about the org. Includes all orgs that the user is in |
| legacyUserId         | The original ID of the user, if the user was migrated from an external source            |

The values of **orgIdToOrgMemberInfo** are **OrgMemberInfo**'s.

### OrgMemberInfo

| OrgMemberInfo                                          | fields/properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| org_id                                                 | The id of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| org_name                                               | The name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| user_assigned_role                                     | The user's role within the organization. See [Roles and Permissions](/overview/roles) for more details.                                                                                                               |
| user_is_role(role: str): bool                          | Returns True if the user's role within the organization matches the `role` passed in                                                                                                                                               |
| user_is_at_least_role(role: str): bool                 | Returns True if the user's role within the organization is at least the `role` passed in. If the hierarchy of roles is Owner => Admin => Member, specifying "Admin" will return True for Admins and Owners, but False for Members. |
| user_has_permission(permission: str): bool             | Return True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |
| user_has_all_permissions(permissions: List[str]): bool | Return True if the user has all the specified permissions. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                            |

#### requireUser

A dependency that will verify the request was made by a valid user. If a valid
access token is provided, it will return that user's information (including
fields like a user_id). If not, the request is rejected with a `401` status
code.

```js
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from propelauth_fastapi import init_auth, User

app = FastAPI()
auth = init_auth("AUTH_URL", "API_KEY")

@app.get("/")
async def root(current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    return {"message": f"Hello {current_user.user_id}"}
```

#### optionalUser

Similar to
[requireUser](/getting-started/backend-integration/fastapi/#require-user), except
if an access token is missing or invalid, the request is allowed to continue,
but the dependency will be None.

```js
from typing import Optional

from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from propelauth_fastapi import init_auth, User

app = FastAPI()
auth = init_auth("AUTH_URL", "API_KEY")

@app.get("/api/whoami_optional")
async def whoami_optional(current_user: Optional[User] = Depends(auth.optional_user)):
    if current_user:
        return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
    return {}

```

#### requireOrgMember

A function that will verify that a user belongs to a specific organization.

```js
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from propelauth_fastapi import init_auth, User

app = FastAPI()
auth = init_auth("AUTH_URL", "API_KEY")

@app.get("/api/org/{org_id}/check")
async def admin_only(org_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    org = auth.require_org_member(current_user, org_id)
    return {"message": f"You are in {org.org_name}"}
```

| Argument        | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| current_user    | The result of require_user                                                                                                                                                      |
| required_org_id | The id of an organization. This function will check that the current user is a member of this org. Typically, this is passed in from the frontend as a query or path parameter. |

Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `403` status code.
2. Return the organization's information for this user.

The returned organization is an **OrgMemberInfo**

### Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles
are **Owner**, **Admin**, or**Member**, but these can be configured. These roles
are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If
you want to check a user's role, you can use **requireOrgMemberWithExactRole**
or **requireOrgMemberWithMinimumRole**.

```js
## Assuming a Role structure of Owner => Admin => Member

@app.get("/api/org/{org_id}/admin_only")
async def admin_only(org_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    org = auth.require_org_member_with_exact_role(current_user, org_id, "Admin")
    return {"message": f"You are an Admin of {org.org_name}"}

@app.get("/api/org/{org_id}/admin_or_owner")
async def admin_or_owner(org_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    org = auth.require_org_member_with_minimum_role(current_user, org_id, "Admin")
    return {"message": f"You are an Admin or Owner of {org.org_name}"}
```

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
**can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**, and **ReadOnly** are all valid
permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **requireOrgMemberWithPermission** or
**requireOrgMemberWithAllPermissions** to check for a given permission.

```js
@app.get("/api/org/{org_id}/billing")
async def billing(org_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    org = auth.require_org_member_with_permission(current_user, org_id, "can_view_billing")
    pass
```

### Usage with API docs

FastAPIs built in documentation will automatically add this button when you are
using either `require_user` or `optional_user`.

![API docs authorze button](/images/authorize_button.png)

You can obtain an access token either from the frontend or by navigating to
`${YOUR_AUTH_URL}/api/v1/refresh_token`.

### API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

```js
// Example
const usersResponse = await fetchUsersByQuery({
  emailOrUsername: "@example.com",
  orderBy: "LAST_ACTIVE_AT_DESC",
});
for (const user of userResponse.users) {
  console.log("Found user " + user);
}
```

See [FastAPI Library Reference](/reference/backend/fastapi) for more information
on available functionality.
