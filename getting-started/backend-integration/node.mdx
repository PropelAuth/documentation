## Quick example

The following example validates an Authorization HTTP header was sent from a
logged-in user.

```js
const propelAuth = require("@propelauth/node");
const { validateAccessTokenAndGetUser } = propelAuth.initBaseAuth({
  // You can find your Auth URL and API key under the Backend Integration
  //   section for your project at https://app.propelauth.com.
  authUrl: "YOUR_AUTH_URL",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const authorizationHeader = // Get the Authorization header from an HTTP request
validateAccessTokenAndGetUser(authorizationHeader).then(
  (user) => {
    console.log(`Got request from user ${user.userId}`);
  },
  (err) => {
    // You can return a 401, or continue the request knowing it wasn't sent from a logged-in user
    console.log(`Unauthorized request ${err}`);
  }
);
```

## How it works

For a detailed description of what's going on under the hood, see [here](/overview/how-our-auth-works).

## Installation

In your Node app, install the **@propelauth/node** library.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
$ npm install --save @propelauth/node
```

```bash yarn
$ yarn add @propelauth/node
```

</CodeGroup>

## Initialize

In a new file, add the following:

```js
// propelauth.js
const propelAuth = require("@propelauth/node");
module.exports = propelAuth.initBaseAuth({
  authUrl: "https://auth.yourdomain.com",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});
```

**initBaseAuth** performs a one-time initialization of the library. It will verify your `apiKey`
is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access tokens in
[validateAccessTokenAndGetUser](#validate-access-token-and-get-user)
and
[validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfo](#validate-access-token-and-get-user-with-org-info).

## Protect API routes

### validateAccessTokenAndGetUser

This function takes in the `Authorization` HTTP header and verifies the request
was made by a valid user. It expects the header to be in the format
`Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`. If the Authorization HTTP header is malformed or doesn't
contain a valid [access token](/overview/access-tokens), an
`UnauthorizedException` is thrown.

```js
const authorizationHeader = // Get the Authorization header from an HTTP request
try {
    const user = await validateAccessTokenAndGetUser(authorizationHeader)
    console.log(`Got request from user ${user.userId}`);
} catch (err) {
    // You can return a 401, or continue the request knowing it wasn't sent from a logged-in user
    console.log(`Unauthorized request ${err}`);
}
```

The **user** object looks like:

| Property             | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| userId               | The id of the user                                                                       |
| orgIdToOrgMemberInfo | A dictionary of org ids to metadata about the org. Includes all orgs that the user is in |
| legacyUserId         | The original ID of the user, if the user was migrated from an external source            |

The values of **orgIdToOrgMemberInfo** are **OrgMemberInfo**'s, with the
following fields/functions:

| OrgMemberInfo                                     | fields/properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Description |

| orgName                                           | The name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| urlSafeOrgName                                    | A URL-safe version of the name of the org                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| assignedRole(): string                            | The user's role within the organization. See [Roles and Permissions](/overview/roles) for more details.                                                                                                               |

| isRole(role: string): boolean                     | Returns True if the user's role within the organization matches the `role` passed in                                                                                                                                               |
| isAtLeastRole(role: string): boolean              | Returns True if the user's role within the organization is at least the `role` passed in. If the hierarchy of roles is Owner => Admin => Member, specifying "Admin" will return True for Admins and Owners, but False for Members. |
| hasPermission(permission: string): boolean        | Return True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |
| hasAllPermissions(permissions: string[]): boolean | Return True if the user has all the specified permissions. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                            |

### validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfo

This function will verify that a request was made by a valid user AND that user
is in an organization.

| Argument                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization HTTP Header | It expects the header to be in the format `Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`. If the `Authorization` HTTP header is malformed or doesn't contain a valid access token, an `UnauthorizedException` is thrown.                                                                                        |
| Required Org Info         | An object with optional fields `orgId` and `orgName`. This function will make sure the user who made the request is a member of an organization with the specified `orgId` and `orgName`. If the user is NOT a member of the specified organization, a `ForbiddenException` is thrown. |

It returns an object with two fields:

```js
{
    user: //...
    orgMemberInfo: //...
}
```

You can see the structure of the `user` and `orgMemberInfo` objects above:
**validateAccessTokenAndGetUser**.

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles
are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured. These
roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If
you want to check a user's role, you can use
**validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithExactRole** or
**validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithMinimumRole**.

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
**can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**, and **ReadOnly** are all valid
permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithPermission** or **validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithAllPermissions** to check for a given permission.

All of these functions, just like **validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfo**, will take in an authorization header and an organization ID. The last parameter is either a role, permission, or list of permissions depending on the function.

## API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

```js
// Example
const usersResponse = await fetchUsersByQuery({
  emailOrUsername: "@example.com",
  orderBy: "LAST_ACTIVE_AT_DESC",
});
for (const user of userResponse.users) {
  console.log("Found user " + user);
}
```

See [Node Library Reference](/reference/backend-apis/node) for more information on
available functionality.
