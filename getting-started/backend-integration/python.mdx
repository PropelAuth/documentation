PropelAuth's Python library provides all the building blocks you need to add
authentication to any Python backend.

For most Python frameworks, like
[FastAPI](/getting-started/backend-integration/fastapi),
[Django](/getting-started/backend-integration/django), and
[Flask](/getting-started/backend-integration/flask), we have built out libraries specifically for them.
Those libraries will provide a more first-class experience than this library.

For the full Python Library Reference, click [here](/reference/backend-apis/python).

## Quick example

The following example creates a route which can only be accessed from logged-in
users.

```python
from propelauth_py import init_base_auth

# You can find your Auth URL and API key under the Backend Integration
#   section for your project at https://app.propelauth.com.
auth = init_base_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

auth_header = # get authorization header in the form `Bearer {TOKEN}`
try:
   user = auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user(auth_header)
   print("Logged in as", user.user_id)
except UnauthorizedException:
   print("Invalid access token")
```

## How it works

For a detailed description of what's going on under the hood, see [here](/overview/how-our-auth-works).

## Installation

```bash
pip install propelauth_py
```

## Initialize

**init_base_auth** performs a one-time initialization of the library.
It will verify your `api_key` is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access tokens in [**validate_access_token_and_get_user**](#validate-access-token-and-get-user) and [**validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org**](#validate-access-token-and-get-user-with-org).

```python
from propelauth_py import init_base_auth

auth = init_base_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Protect API routes

### validate_access_token_and_get_user

This function takes in the `Authorization` HTTP header and verifies the request
was made by a valid user. It expects the header to be in the format
`Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`. If the Authorization HTTP header is malformed or doesn't
contain a valid [access token](/overview/access-tokens), an
`UnauthorizedException` is thrown.

Otherwise, a [User](#user) is returned.

```python
auth_header = # get authorization header in the form `Bearer {TOKEN}`
try:
   user = auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user(auth_header)
   print("Logged in as", user.user_id)
except UnauthorizedException:
   print("Invalid access token")
```

### validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org

This function will verify that a request was made by a valid user AND that user
is in an organization.

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured.
These roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If you want to check a user's role, you can use **auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org_by_minimum_role** or **auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org_by_exact_role**
which will very the request was made by a valid user, that user is in the specified organization, AND that the user's within the organization matches what was passed in.

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example, **can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**,
and **ReadOnly** are all valid permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org_by_permission** or **auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org_by_all_permissions** to check for a given permission.

All of these functions, just like [validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org](#validate-access-token-and-get-user-with-org),
will take in an authorization header and an organization ID.
The last parameter is either a role, permission, or list of permissions depending on the function.

## API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

See [Python Library Reference](/reference/backend-apis/python) for more information
on available functionality.
