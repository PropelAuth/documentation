  "PropelAuth's Python library provides all the building blocks you need to add
  authentication to any Python backend. For most Python frameworks, like
  FastAPI, Django, and Flask, we have built out libraries specifically for them,
  and they will provide a more first-class experience than this library."

### Quick example

The following example creates a route which can only be accessed from logged-in
users.

```js
from propelauth_py import init_base_auth

auth = init_base_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", #
                      "YOUR_API_KEY") #

auth_header = # get authorization header in the form `Bearer {TOKEN}`
try:
   user = auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user(auth_header)
   print("Logged in as", user.user_id)
except UnauthorizedException:
   print("Invalid access token")

```

### How it works

The front-end receives an [access token](/overview-and-concpets/access-tokens).
This access token is provided in an `Authorization` header when an HTTP request
is made.

PropelAuth provides you with metadata that you use to validate the access token
and figure out who it belongs to. The complexity of fetching the metadata and
validating the tokens is hidden in the
[Python library](/reference/backend/python).

### Installation

In your Node app, install the **@propelauth/node** library.

```bash
$ pip install propelauth_py
```

### Initialize

**initBaseAuth** performs a one-time initialization of the library. It will
verify your `apiKey` is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access
tokens in
[validateAccessTokenAndGetUser](/getting-started/backend-integration/python/#validate-access-token-and-get-user)
and
[validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfo](/getting-started/backend-integration/python/#validate-access-token-and-get-user-with-org).

```js
from propelauth_py import init_base_auth

auth = init_base_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", #
                      "YOUR_API_KEY") #
```

### Protect API routes

### User

A user returned by
[validateAccessTokenAndGetUser](/getting-started/backend-integration/python/#validate-access-token-and-get-user)
and
[validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfo](/getting-started/backend-integration/python/#validate-access-token-and-get-user-with-org).

#### validate_access_token_and_get_user

This function takes in the `Authorization` HTTP header and verifies the request
was made by a valid user. It expects the header to be in the format
`Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`. If the Authorization HTTP header is malformed or doesn't
contain a valid [access token](/overview/access-tokens), an
`UnauthorizedException` is thrown.

```js
auth_header = # get authorization header in the form `Bearer {TOKEN}`
try:
   user = auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user(auth_header)
   print("Logged in as", user.user_id)
except UnauthorizedException:
   print("Invalid access token")

```

### validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org

This function will verify that a request was made by a valid user AND that user
is in an organization.

| Authorization HTTP Header | It expects the header to be in the format `Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`. If the `Authorization` HTTP header is malformed or doesn't contain a valid access token, an `UnauthorizedException` is thrown.                                                                                        |
| Required Org Info         | An object with optional fields `orgId` and `orgName`. This function will make sure the user who made the request is a member of an organization with the specified `orgId` and `orgName`.

The return value has a user and a `org_member_info` containing the following

### Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles
are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured. These
roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If
you want to check a user's role, you can use
**validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithExactRole** or
**validateAccessTokenAndGetUserWithOrgInfoWithMinimumRole**.

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
**can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**, and **ReadOnly** are all valid
permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **requireOrgMemberWithPermission** or
**requireOrgMemberWithAllPermissions** to check for a given permission.

All of these functions, just like **requireOrgMember**, can also take in
**orgIdExtractor**, and will set both **req.user** and **req.org** on a valid
request.

### API calls

In addition to protecting API routes, you can make requests to PropelAuth to
fetch more information about your users or organizations. You can also create
new users, update user metadata, and more.

```js
// Example
const usersResponse = await fetchUsersByQuery({
  emailOrUsername: "@example.com",
  orderBy: "LAST_ACTIVE_AT_DESC",
});
for (const user of userResponse.users) {
  console.log("Found user " + user);
}
```

See [Python Library Reference](/reference/backend/python) for more information
on available functionality.
