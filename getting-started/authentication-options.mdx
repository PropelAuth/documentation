By default, your project is configured with both password and passwordless authentication.
This represents a nice default, however, you can enable/disable either of these options.

## Social login / SSO

Social login / SSO allows your users to login using their existing social
network accounts (e.g. Google, Github, Microsoft). It makes signing up simpler
for your users, as they don't have to remember a password.

Enabling social logins with PropelAuth is a breeze since the majority of the
work is done by your [hosted authentication pages](/overview/hosted-pages).

Instructions for enabling Social login are dependent on the specific social
network you want to integrate with.

## Account Linking

If a user signs up with a social provider after signing up with their email address, their accounts will automatically
be linked.

## User login duration

You can control how long users stay logged in for in your dashboard. You can choose between your users staying
logged in for a fixed amount of time or having them stay logged in as long as they remain active.
