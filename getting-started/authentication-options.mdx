title: "Login methods"
---

By default, your project is configured with both password and passwordless authentication.
You can enable or disable these methods in your dashboard, as well as enable social login and SSO.

## Passwords

A classic login method, passwords are the most common way for users to sign up and log in to your app.

We add extra security for your users by disallowing them from using common passwords. We also protect your from
brute force attacks by limiting the number of failed login attempts.

## Passwordless

Passwordless authentication allows users to log in without a password. This is done by sending a one-time
password to the user's email address.

We manage the entire process for you, including sending the email and verifying the one-time password.
If you'd like to send emails from your own domain, email us at [support@propelauth.com](mailto:support@propelauth.com)
and we'll get you set up.

## Social login / SSO

Social login / SSO allows your users to login using their existing social
network accounts (e.g. Google, Github, Microsoft). It makes signing up simpler
for your users, as they don't have to remember a password.

Enabling social logins with PropelAuth is a breeze since the majority of the
work is done by your [hosted authentication pages](/overview/hosted-pages).

Instructions for enabling Social login are dependent on the specific social
network you want to integrate with.

### Account Linking

If a user signs up with a social provider after signing up with their email address, their accounts will automatically
be linked.

## Enterprise SSO (SAML)

Enterprise SSO (SAML) allows your users to login using their existing enterprise accounts (e.g. Okta, OneLogin, Azure AD).

It's often a requirement for enterprise customers to use their existing enterprise accounts to login to your app.

We provide self-service UIs for your customers to set up their own SAML connections. You can read more about PropelAuth's SAML
support [here](/overview/saml).

## User login duration

You can control how long users stay logged in for in your dashboard. You can choose between your users staying
logged in for a fixed amount of time or having them stay logged in as long as they remain active.
