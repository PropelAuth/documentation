Your backend may want to perform the following actions:

1. Determine which users made an HTTP request
2. Reject requests from users that are not logged in
3. Fetch usersâ€™ metadata by user_id, email, username, and more.
4. (B2B Only) Require users to be members of an organization to perform actions
5. (B2B Only) Require users to have a sufficient role within an organization to
   perform actions

PropelAuth provides a library that integrates with your backend to achieve these
functions. Select your framework below for more detailed instructions.
