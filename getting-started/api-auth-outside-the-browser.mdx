### Overview

API Key authentication allows you to create API Keys for your end users and your organizations in order to protect requests they make to your product.

This assists in verifying requests made to products in a browserless contexts, such as CLI's, cURL, etc., without needing to create 
browser based frontend authentication.

### Token Types

There are three different kinds of API Keys that PropelAuth can generate, based on the desired use case.

<Tabs>
	<Tab title="Personal">
		An API key tied to a user. If the user is blocked/deleted, the API key is blocked/deleted as well. Validating this will return the userâ€™s information.
	</Tab>
	<Tab title="Organization">
		An API key tied to an organization. Revoked when the organization is deleted and (optionally) when the user who created the key leaves the org.
	</Tab>
	<Tab title="Generic">
		Not tied to a user or organization. These can only be made programmatically and is more for cases where you want different backend systems to talk to each other.
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Basic Usage

First, your users create an API Key via our configurable [hosted pages](/overview/hosted-pages) (you can also create them manually via our APIs if you want to manage it yourself)

Next, when a user makes a request to your product, they will send this key in their request.

Finally, your product makes a request to our [validation API endpoints](/reference/backend-apis/node#validate-personal-api-key) to make sure 
that the token is valid, and we return the user or organization that the token was issued to, along with any relevant metadata.

### Setup 

First enable API Key Authentication in your Project. In the API Key Settings section of the dashboard, make
 sure that you enable your prefered feature, either Personal or Organization API Keys, or both.

![Settings](/images/api-key-auth-settings.png)

Click on the **Live View** button on the top right, and click on the API Key hosted page or pages you enabled.

![Hosted Pages](/images/api-key-auth-hosted-page.png)

These pages are where you will redirect your customers to create their API Keys. 

### Validate Requests from your customers

Once a customer has generated an API Key for their requests, they can then send that key in the header of their requests to your product. You 
can then verify that the request is coming from a real user by hitting our validation endpoints, and receive from PropelAuth any relevant metadata about 
the requester.

As an example, below is a snippet of a potential **Express** backend that is logging to the console the user returned from the **validatePersonalApiKey** endpoint.

```js
app.post('/api/whoami', async (req, res) => {
    const user = await auth.validatePersonalApiKey(req.headers.authorization)
    console.log(user)
})
```

Output

```JSON
user: {
	"user_id":"98cef184-7c15-45c5-8918-8c2295aa7ffe",
