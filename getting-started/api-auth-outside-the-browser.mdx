In this guide, weâ€™re going to walk through how to create API Keys for both Users and Organizations.

### Overview

API Key authentication allows you to create authenticated API Keys for your end users to use in order to access your product's endpoints. Using PropelAuth, you can create
 and manage API Keys for both your Users and your Organizations, and validate requests sent to you using validation.

### Basic Usage

In terms of the most basic usage of API Key Authentication, it is designs to be as straightforward as possible for both you and your users.

First, an API Key is created using either our client library endpoints or our hosted pages.

Next, when a user or a member of an organization makes a request to your product, they will send this key along with their request as a header.

Finally, your product makes a request to our validation API endpoint to make sure that the token is valid, and we return the user or organization that the token was issued to,
 and any relevant metadata associated with it.

### Setup 

First, in order to use API Key Authentication, you have to make sure that it is enabled in your PropelAuth Project. In the API Key Settings section of the dashboard, make
 sure that you enable your prefered feature, either Personal or Organization API Keys.

Click on the **Live View** button on the top right, and click on the API Key hosted page you would live to interact with. These are the hosted pages that you will redirect your
 customers to in your product to create their keys.

### Validate Requests from your customers

Once one of your customers has generated an API Key for their requests, they can then send that key in the header of their requests to your endpoints. Then, using 
our validation endpoints, you can can verify that the request is coming from a real user, and receieve any relavent metadata from the requester.

As an example, below is a snippet of a potential Express backend that is just logging to the console the user metadata for a request after using the **validatePersonalApiKey** endpoint.

```js
app.post('/api/company-names', async (req, res) => {
    req.user = await auth.validatePersonalApiKey(req.headers.authorization)
    const userMetadata = req.apiKey.userMetadata
    console.log(userMetadata)
})
```
