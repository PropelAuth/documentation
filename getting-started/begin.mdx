A project encompasses all the authentication for your application. To get
started, [click here](https://auth.propelauth.com) to sign up and create your project.

### Create your project

All you need to start is a name. Once you've created your project, a test
environment is created.

You start off with a default logo, color scheme, and the option of either
password or passwordless authentication. At this point, you can fully test what
your end users will experience, transactional emails included. The dashboard has
a link to your signup/login pages. After logging in, you'll also see your
account page where your users can enroll in 2FA and change their settings.

Let's continue by configuring the look and feel of these pages.

### Hosted authentication pages

Click **Hosted Auth Pages** in the sidebar after creating your project to
configure the look and feel of your entire authentication experience.

This will configure every UI (account, login, signup, forgot password, etc) and
email that we send.

### Social login / SSO _(optional)_

Social login / SSO allows your users to login using their existing social
network accounts (e.g. Google, Github, Microsoft). It makes signing up simpler
for your users, as they don't have to remember a password.

Enabling social logins with PropelAuth is a breeze since the majority of the
work is done by your hosted authentication pages. If a user signs up with a
social provider after signing up with email, their accounts will automatically
be linked.

Instructions for enabling Social login are dependent on the specific social
network you want to integrate with.
[Click here for a full list of providers with instructions](/reference/social-login).

### Organizations / B2B Support

PropelAuth allows your users to create and manage
[organizations](/overview/organizations).

They can also invite their coworkers to these organizations and manage their
coworkers' roles. Our libraries allow you to access organization information.

### User Schema

There are a few more options to customize the user experience. They can be found
under **User Schema** in the sidebar.

Enabling an extra field has a few effects:

- Your signup page will now also ask for that field (except for profile picture,
  where we start them off with a default).

- Users that sign in via passwordless login (which only asks for email address),
  will be asked to complete their account when they first sign up.
- Existing users will be asked to fill in that field when they next sign up.
- Your users can update those fields on your hosted account pages.

### Passwordless / Magic Links

By default, we allow users to sign up via password or passwordless logins. You
can read more about it
[here](https://www.propelauth.com/post/passwordless-support). The **Project
Settings** section of your project allows you to configure this.

### Next step: Integration

Congrats! You have fully configured your authentication experience. Right now,
after you sign up and confirm your email, you will be redirected to the Account
page. This is only temporary.

Once you integrate your frontend, you will instead be redirected to your
application.
