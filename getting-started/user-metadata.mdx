title: "User Metadata"

By default, the only required field a user needs is an email address. There are a few more options to customize the
user experience. They can be found under **User Schema** in the sidebar.

Enabling an extra field has a few effects:

- Your signup page will now also ask for that field (except for profile picture,
  where we start them off with a default).

- Users that sign in via passwordless login (which only asks for email address),
  will be asked to provide the extra field when they first sign up.
- Existing users will be asked to fill in that field when they next sign up.
- Your users can update those fields on your hosted account pages.
