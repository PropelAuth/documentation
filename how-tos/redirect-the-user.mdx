A seamless authentication experience for users is key to working with PropelAuth, which means we have provided various methods of redirecting 
your users to the correct location.

## Default Locations

In the PropelAuth Dashboard, you can specify the default redirect location from the Frontend Integration section.

In this case, after the user logs in or logs out of the test environment, they will be redirected to http://localhost:8000

## Overriding the Defaults

While you can rely on the defaults set in your dashboard, what if you have custom locations you would like to send your 
users to? Well, using our frontend libraries, you can do just that.

When you are sending the user to the login/signup pages, you have the option to specify where they will come back to 
after they complete that action. For example, let’s say I have users clicking a **Login** button at the domain `example.com`, 
but after a successful login, I want to direct them to `example.com/onboarding`.

All it would take would be to make sure that in my redirect function on the frontend, I pass that URL as the `postLoginRedirectUrl`.

```js
redirectToLoginPage({
	postLoginRedirectUrl: 'https://propelauth.com/account'
})
```

Now I could have done this by changing the default redirect location to “/account” in my dashboard. But this method 
works for programatic redirects as well. Let’s say I have a contextual instance_id that I need to pass into the URL. To do this, 
I would need to do it pass in

```js
redirectToLoginPage({
	postLoginRedirectUrl: `https://propelauth.com/${instance_id}`
})
```

## Redirect to the Current Page 

What if you wanted to redirect the user back to their current page in your app after they login? In that case, 
you could use the same method as before, but this time we would pass in a window reference as the URL.

```js
redirectToLoginPage({
	postLoginRedirectUrl: window.location.href
})
```

In this case, a user would be redirected back to whatever page they were on when they initially clicked to login to the application. 

We can even do this automatically across your whole application, like in following example, where we passed in a `RedirectToLogin` 
component to the `RequiredAuthProvider`.

```js
<RequiredAuthProvider
  authUrl={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL || ""}
  displayIfLoggedOut={
    <RedirectToLogin
      postLoginRedirectUrl={window.location.href}
    />
  }
>
  {children}
</RequiredAuthProvider>
```


## Redirect to a Preview Deployment 

In some cases, you may want to redirect to a preview deployment of the application. Some platforms, like Netlify, Vercel, 
and Render have support for preview deployments, but how would you make sure you come back to the right place after logging in?

To accomplish this, first you'll need to add an additional frontend location to the frontend integration section of your dashboard.

Once added, you can then use the above examples with `window.location.href` and it will automatically redirect back to the 
preview deployment instead of your default.
