A seamless authentication experience for users is key to working with PropelAuth, which means we have provided various methods of redirecting 
your users to the correct location.

## Default Locations

In the PropelAuth Dashboard, you can specify various redirect locations from the Frontend Integration section.

You can specify default locations for after a user is logged in, and after they are logged out. You can also add additional locations that can access user information 
from this page as well.

## Overriding the Defaults

While you can rely on the defaults set in your dashboard, what if you have custom locations you would like to send your users to? Well, using our frontend libraries, 
you can do just that.

We have provided a suite of redirect functions for use in your application, so that you can direct your users to the various hosted UI's that we provide for authentication. 
That said, each of these functions come with an optional `postSignupRedirectUrl` parameter, which allows you to specify the URL you would like to redirect to.

For example, let's say I have users clicking a link to log in at the domain `propelauth.com`, but after a successful login, I want to direct them to `app.propelauth.com`. 

First, In My dashboard, I would add a new frontend location for this second domain, and make sure to click "Allow any subdomain".

Second, I would integrate PropelAuth into my frontend as I normally would, but in the component that let's users log in, I would specify the 
new domain in the options

```js
redirectToLoginPage({
	postLoginRedirectUrl: 'https://app.propelauth.com'
})
```
