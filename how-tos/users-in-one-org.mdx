title: "Maximum Number of Users Per Org"

---

When creating a pricing structure for your product, it's common to limit the number of users in an organization depending 
on the plan your customer is currently paying for. But how do you accomplish this in PropelAuth?

## Setting a Max User Limit 

Let's say you have a pricing model that has three tiers and plans

- Hobbyist, meaning team size is max 1
- Startup, meaning team size is max 5
- Growth, meaning unlimited team size

When an organization selects a plan, you will want to set a limit based on the plan they are paying for

To do this, you will want to update the organization they are a part of programatically. Using one of our libraries, you would 
use the [update organization](/reference/backend-apis/node#update-organization-metadata) endpoint to create a maximum limit of 
users in the specified organization. For example, if running a Node backend, it would looks comething like:

```js
 function updateOrgWithNewPricingInfo(plan, orgId) {
	if (plan === "hobby") {
		auth.updateOrg(orgId, { maxUsers: 1 })
	} else if (plan === "startup") {
		auth.updateOrg(orgId, { maxUsers: 5 })
	} else {
		auth.updateOrg(orgId, { maxUsers: 100000 })
	}
}
```

## Connecting with a Payment System 

In order to properly accomplish this kind of pricing limitation, you need a mapping from your organization to a payment system, 
like Stripe. If you want to do this programmatically, you can use our webhooks and listen to the `org.created` event.
