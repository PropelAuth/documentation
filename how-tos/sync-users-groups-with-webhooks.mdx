title: "Webhooks [TODO]"
description:
  "Webhooks allow you to reliably receive an HTTP request when a specific action
  occurs, like a user signing up, joining an organization, or having their role
  change."
---

Some examples of things you can do include:

- Creating a copy of your users and organizations in your DB
- Signing up new users to your mailing list and sending them a welcome email
- Provisioning resources for a user right when they sign up
- Updating your billing information as new users join organizations within your
  product

You can set them up by going to the **Webhook** section of your
[dashboard](https://auth.propelauth.com/signup). You can set up different
endpoints for your test and production environments, so you can easily
distinguish between the two. There's also a full event catalog with examples of
what the events look like.

We use [Svix](https://www.svix.com/) for our Webhooks. To make sure that the
requests are actually coming from us and not from a malicious actor, make sure
to
[verify the messages you receive](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how).
