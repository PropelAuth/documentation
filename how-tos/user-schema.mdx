  "Users always have an email address and id. You can enable additional fields
  like name, username, or profile picture in your dashboard."

Enabling an extra field has a few effects:

- Your signup page will now also ask for that field (except for profile picture,
  where we start them off with a default).

- Users that sign in via passwordless login (which only asks for email address),
  will be asked to complete their account when they first sign up.

- Existing users will be asked to fill in that field when they next sign up.
- Your users can update those fields on your hosted account pages.

In addition, your users will always be able to use the account page to set or
update common fields like email or password.

We also provide a tool for your users to upload and crop profile pictures.
