title: "UI Customization"
---

Once your project is created, you have a full set of [UIs](/overview/hosted-pages) that are hosted on your behalf.
To customize them, go to the **Look & Feel** section of your dashboard.

You can also see a demo of the types of customizations you can do, [here](https://demo.propelauth.com).

This will configure every UI (account, login, signup, forgot password, etc) and will also set a color scheme for the
[emails](/overview/emails) that we send.
