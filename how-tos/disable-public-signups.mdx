title: "Disable public signups"

  "When you are in the early stages of your business, you might want to onboard
  customers manually instead of having open signups."

PropelAuth already makes it easy for you to sign up users and their coworkers,
but this is actually a case where you don't want that. The only users you want
are ones you explicitly choose and no one else. Maybe these are only people on
your waitlist, or maybe these are friends and family, or maybe it's people that
you've given a demo to and are really excited about what you are building.

To disable signups, go to the **Signup / Login ** section of your
[project](https://app.propelauth.com/signup), go to the **Settings** tab, and 
uncheck **Allow public user signups**.

This will do a few obvious things, like removing the user facing signup page and
any links to it, and now no new users are allowed to sign up for your product. 
However, if a user is manually invited to an organization, they **are** allowed to sign up.

It will also do a few subtle things, like if you enabled SSO (e.g. a "Login with
Google" button), it will still allow users to login, but only if a verified
account already exists with a matching email address.

Users will only be allowed to log in if you explicitly allow them to - which you
can do via our admin dashboard. This way you can have full control over who can
access your product.
