|--|----|
| **Feature** | New “metadata” fields have been added to the user and organization objects where you can assign JSON objects of customizable data. |
| **Feature** | We now provide access to email, name, and username on the JWT. Previously, to access this data you would need to make another external request to us. |
| **Beta** | Added `user_id` and `org_id` query options for API Authentication. Previously you would have to sort through all results at once. |
| **Release** | Recently underwent our annual penetration testing via 3rd party, and we passed. Find more [here](https://www.propelauth.com/post/propelauths-annual-security-audit-2023). |

### 2023-03-31

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Bugfix** | "Create Org" and "Join Org" now on the same page as separated functions. Previously, if you disabled the ability for users to create organizations, the “join org” functionality would be hidden as well. Users can now join organizations regardless of their ability to create one. |
| **Bugfix** | Changed the "disable public signups" option so that invited users can still create an account even if the feature is turned on. Previously this feature was blocking some users who were invited and choose to join through SSO, but this has been fixed. |
| **Bugfix** | Fixed Microsoft login issue. For users that didn’t have their first name or last name set in their Microsoft account, signing in with Microsoft was failing. This only affected users who enabled the “collect name on signup” feature. We’ve resolved this issue, and users can now sign in seamlessly with their Microsoft account, and if we cannot pull their first and last name from Microsoft, we prompt the user to provide it afterwards |
| **Bugfix** | Increased the acceptance time for confirmation emails to 5 days (previously it was only 2) |
| **Bugfix** | Made small styling fixes to our component library and hosted pages to improve the overall look and feel of the platform |

### 2023-03-15

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Feature** | Added an API to create access tokens for testing purposes. Previously, you would need to use our frontend libraries to get tokens, and the tokens were all short-lived. Now you can make an API call to get an access token for a specified user, with a custom expiration. |
| **Feature** | Added `refreshAuthInfo` to @propelauth/react so you can force refresh the auth information |
| **Feature** | Improved `useAuthInfo` so that you can now destructure without needing to check `loading` first |
| **Feature** | Added new redirect function `redirectToSetupSAMLPage` |
| **Feature** | For each redirect function (e.g. redirectToLoginPage), we now also provide a getter function to get the underlying URL (e.g. getLoginPageURL). This allows for more flexible usage. |
| **Bugfix** | Fixed issue with `fetch_org` in the Rust crate where it's return type was incorrect |
| **Bugfix** | Updating your email no longer sends a confirmation if you had "email confirmation not required" in that environment |
