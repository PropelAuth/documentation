PropelAuth provides you with [full UIs](/overview/hosted-pages) out of the box. This means that you don't have to
worry about any login/signup/account management flows.

This often raises the question - how do you get a user's information within your product?
PropelAuth provides [frontend libraries](/getting-started/frontend-integration) for frameworks like React,
no-code tools like Webflow, and vanilla javascript.

These libraries provide abstractions for common frontend use cases like:
 - "Tell me if the user is logged in or not"
 - "Get the current user's information"
 - "Does this user have permission to see this page"
 - "Make an **authenticated** request to the backend"

The [getting started guide](/getting-started/quickstart-fe) provides detailed examples for your framework of choice.
