description:
  "RBAC, short for role based access control, is a method where you assign each
  user a role. You can then determine what they have access to based on their
  role."

By default, PropelAuth provides you with three roles:

- Owner
- Admin
- Member

Importantly, these roles apply only within the context of an organization. One
of your users can be an Owner of organization A and a Member of organization B.
Those roles dictate permissions within the organization - not globally.

### Can I change the default roles?

Yes. In your dashboard, under **Roles and Permissions**, you can create roles
that make sense for your product.

### How do users get assigned roles?

PropelAuth enables your end users to manage their own roles via their org
management hosted page.

You can also manage your users roles yourself in the PropelAuth dashboard or via
our APIs.

### What can I do with roles?

PropelAuth's libraries treat these roles as a first-class concept on both the
frontend and backend. You can then easily:

- Reject an HTTP request if the user is not at least an **Admin** in this
  organization
- Conditionally render the frontend based on the user's role in an organization
- Limit who can send organization invitations based on their role

### What are permissions?

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
**can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**, and **ReadOnly** are all valid
permissions.

These permissions are associated with your roles. A user with the role **Admin**
will also have all the permissions associated with the role **Admin**. You can
then easily:

- Reject an HTTP request if the user does not have the **can_view_billing**
  permission.
- Conditionally render the frontend based on the user's permissions.

### What is the difference between roles and permissions?

Roles and permissions both enable you to check what a user can and cannot do
within your product. Your users will directly interact with their role (e.g. by
inviting a coworker as an Admin within their organization). Your users will NOT
directly interact with their permissions. A users' permissions are derived from
their role.

One advantage of permissions over roles is it allows you to think about the
concrete actions each role can do. Your codebase just has to check those
concrete actions without worrying about the role.
