## At A Glance

As soon as you load into the dashboard, you're greeted with a glance at the metrics you care about. We collect the total number of users, the total number of organizations, 
and month-over-month measurements of user signups, active users, and active organizations.

## User Insights

Additionally, under User Insights, you can view reports around Churned and Reengaged Users and Organizations.

<Note>User Insights are a paid feature. While you can use this feature in your Test environment, you must be on a paid plan in order to view these reports in Production.</Note>

Churned Users displays the users that have not been active in the last 7, 14, or 30 days. Churned Organizations displays organizations where all users haven't been 
active in 7, 14, or 30 days. These reports provide early insights into customers who haven't used the product for a specified period, allowing you to focus on retention efforts.

Reengaged Users displays the users that have used your product in the last week or month, and who had previously been considered inactive in that selected period. Reengaged 
Organizations displays the same information but for organizations where at least one user in that organization used your product. These reports can give your team an early 
indication of the success of your efforts to reduce churn.
