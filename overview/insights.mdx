## At A Glance

the number of user signups, active users and active organizations for the current and previous month.

## User Insights

We also provide more in-depth user insights in the form of Charts of and Reports. These are available under the User Insights tab in the dashboard.

<Note>User Insights are a paid feature. While you can use this feature in your Test environment, you must be on a paid plan in order to view these reports in Production.</Note>

### Reports

We currently offer 2 kinds of reports: Churned & Re-engaged.

The Churned Users report displays the users that have not been active in the last 7, 14, or 30 days, and the Churned Organizations report displays organizations where every 
member of that organization hasn't been active in those same periods. These reports identify which users and organizations have not used your product during specific time 
frames, which means you can then reach out to try and reengage them.

Our reengagement reports let you see if those efforts are successful! The Reengaged Users report displays the users who have used your product in the last week or month and 
were inactive in previous week or month. The Reengaged Organizations report displays the organizations where where all of the users were previously inactive, but now at least 
one user in that organization has returned.
