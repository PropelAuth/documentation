title: "Transactional Emails"
description: "We send emails to your users for common actions."

For example:

- Passwordless logins
- Reset password emails
- Organization invitations

These emails will share the same color scheme and style you configure for your
hosted authentication pages. We manage these emails for you, so you don't need
to connect an external provider.

If you would like us to send the emails from a specific email address (like
welcome@yourcompany.com), send us an email at support@propelauth.com and we'll
get you set up.
