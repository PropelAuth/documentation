## Frontend Integration

PropelAuth provides you with [full UIs](/overview/hosted-pages) out of the box. This means that you don't have to
worry about any login/signup/account management flows.

This often raises the question - how do you get a user's information within your product?
PropelAuth provides [frontend libraries](/getting-started/frontend-integration) for frameworks like React,
no-code tools like Webflow, and vanilla javascript.

These libraries provide abstractions for common frontend use cases like:
 - "Tell me if the user is logged in or not"
 - "Get the current user's information"
 - "Does this user have permission to see this page"
 - "Make an **authenticated** request to the backend"

The [getting started guide](/getting-started/quickstart-fe) provides detailed examples for your framework of choice.



## Backend Integration

PropelAuth provides [hosted UIs](/overview/hosted-pages) and [frontend libraries](/overview/frontend-integration),
but what about the backend?

On the backend, we provide [libraries](/getting-started/frontend-integration) for languages like Node, Python, and Rust.
We then also provide more specific libraries for frameworks like Express (node), FastAPI (python), Flask (python), etc.

These libraries provide abstractions for common backend use cases like:
 - "Only allow users that are logged in to call this API"
 - "Only allow users that are Admins of this organization to call this API"
 - "Block this user"
 - "Fetch all users in an organization"

Essentially, every backend library has two components to it:
 - Functions for authentication/authorization - making sure the user has permission to perform some action
 - APIs on top of PropelAuth - fetch user information, modify/create users, change roles, etc.
