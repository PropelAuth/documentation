  "Organizations are groups of your users that will use your product together."

These are also referred to as companies, tenants, teams, workspaces, or shared
accounts. Let's say you are building a product that helps people create and
share documents internally. Your customers might include:

- A two-person startup
- A fast-growing 50-person tech company
- A hobbyist using you by themselves, but who might get more employees someday
- A large enterprise

Each of these would be an organization within your product, managed by
PropelAuth.

### How are orgs created?

There are three ways to create an organization.

1. Your end users can create them themselves. Just like the signup and login
   pages, PropelAuth provides a UI for your end users to create these
   organizations. Our frontend libraries provide functions for you to redirect
   your users to the "create org" page and to get which orgs the user is a
   member of.

2. You can use the PropelAuth dashboard to create organizations for your users.
3. You can use our APIs to create organizations programmatically.

### How do users get added to orgs?

PropelAuth provides a management UI for your users as well. This enables them to
send invitations, manage [roles](/overview/roles), remove users
from the organization, and more.

A user that received an invitation will be prompted to sign up if they haven't
yet. Afterwards, they can accept or decline the invitation.

Your users can also allow anyone with a matching email domain to automatically
join at the lowest role (e.g. everyone from **@acme.com** can join the Acme
Organization).

We also support [SAML](/overview/saml) which enables your customers
to connect their organization membership directly to their identity provider
(like Okta, OneLogin, or JumpCloud).

### Can users be in multiple orgs?

By default, yes, users can create and join multiple organizations. However, you can configure this in your dashboard
and change it so users can only be in one organization at a time.

### Do I need to use orgs?

Organizations are useful when you are want to sign up teams at a time. If you aren't there yet, you can disable
them in your dashboard, which will also turn off the hosted UIs.
