  "When a new user signs up, you likely want to be notified quickly. Typically,
  this might just be a message in Slack notifying you that a user has signed up."

To make this really easy, we've added a **Notifications** section to your
dashboard. You enter a
[Slack webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks), and we'll notify
you every time a new user signs up. You can also set different webhooks for your
test and production environments, to avoid the long list of fake notifications
(`test@mycompany.com`, `test2@mycompany.com`, ...).

If you are looking for more advanced actions on user signup or other events, you
likely want [webhooks](/overview/webhooks).
