### Overview

User impersonation is an advanced feature that allows you to sign in to your product as one of your users.
Given the sensitive nature of this operation, only the Owner of an organization can turn it on.
Afterwards, Owners and Admins can select which of your employees have access to this feature.

### Enabling User Impersonation

To enable user impersonation, go to the **Project Settings** in your dashboard. Then click the **Configure** button under **User Impersonation**.

In the sidebar, the Owner of your organization will be able to enable user impersonation for your organization,
and select which of your employees have access to this feature.

### Using User Impersonation

Once user impersonation is enabled, you can use it by going to the **Users** section of your dashboard.
Find the user you want to impersonate, click the **Actions** button, and select **Impersonate User**.

After a confirmation, you will be signed in as that user. The login will only last for 1 hour, and you will be
automatically signed out after that time.

### Distinguishing Impersonated Users

When you (or someone on your team) is impersonating a user, they will be able to perform actions as that user, within your product.
You may, for example, want to:

- Limit the actions that can be performed while impersonating a user
- Audit the actions that were performed while impersonating a user
- Limit the data that can be viewed while impersonating a user
- Add a banner to your product, indicating that the user is being impersonated

To help you distinguish between a user and an impersonated user, there's a new `impersonatorUserId` field on the user object,
in both the frontend and the backend. This field will be set to the ID of the person on your team who is impersonating the user, if any.

In React, for example, you could use this field to add a banner to your product, indicating that the user is being impersonated:

```jsx
import { withAuthInfo } from "@propelauth/react"

const UserBanner = withAuthInfo({ impersonatorUserId }) => {
  if (impersonatorUserId) {
    return <div className="user-banner">(!) Currently Impersonating</div>
  } else {
    return null
  }
}
```

In the backend, you could use this field to limit the actions that can be performed while impersonating a user:

```js
// Express example
app.post("/api/sensitive-action", auth.requireUser, (req, res) => {
  if (req.user.impersonatorUserId) {
    res.status(403).send("You cannot perform this action while impersonating a user")
  } else {
    // Perform the sensitive action
  }
})
```
