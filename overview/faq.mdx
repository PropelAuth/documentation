### What is my test environment for?

Your test environment enables you to test your integration locally without
messing with production data.

Your test environment is set up to allow requests from localhost, so you can
develop locally, whereas your production environment allows requests only from
your domain.

### What is the full list of use cases handled by the hosted authentication pages?

These are the pages that are exposed to your end users. You can see how they
look when you style them on our [demo site](https://demo.propelauth.com/).

- Signup (password, passwordless, and social)
- Login (password, passwordless, social, and SAML)
- Onboarding - Ask users to specify additional information like username before
  they are fully set up
- Email confirmation pages (confirm my email/resend email confirmation)
- Forgotten password pages (I forgot my password/update my forgotten password)
- Update account information
- Enable/Disable 2FA
- Upload profile picture
- Update password, email, user metadata
- Social login OAuth redirect pages
- Create / join organizations
- Manage organizations (invite new users, manage user's roles within an org,
  remove users from org)
- Display pending organization invitations (and accept/reject them)
- [SAML](/overview/saml) setup via wizards
- [Testing the SAML connection](/overview/saml)
- Security features like user lockout and breached password detection

Are we missing a feature that's important to you? Please email us at
support@propelauth.com.

### What happens if I want to switch auth providers in the future?

No problem. We can provide a full export of your user data upon request.

### Can I migrate from another provider?

Absolutely! See our guide about migrations
[here](/overview/migrate-existing-users). Since every provider is
different, we can also manually help with the migration process. Get in touch at
support@propelauth.com.

### I logged in to my test environment but my frontend doesn't say I'm logged in

For privacy reasons, some browsers will restrict sending cookies across domains.
In your production environment, this isn't an issue because you have a custom
domain (`https://auth.yourdomain.com`).

This can be an issue for your test environment which sends requests from
localhost to your test environment (e.g. `https://yourid.propelauthtest.com`).
Resolving this is different in each browser.

In Firefox, for example, if you have enabled **Strict** Enhanced Tracking
Protection, you'll need to disable it just for localhost by clicking the shield
next to the url like this:

<Note>
  This is only applicable locally for some configurations of some browsers. Your
  end users will **not** need to do this.
