### What is my test environment for?

Your test environment enables you to test your integration locally without
messing with production data.

Your test environment is set up to allow requests from localhost, so you can
develop locally, whereas your production environment allows requests only from
your domain.

### What happens if I want to switch auth providers in the future?

No problem. We can provide a full export of your user data upon request.

### Can I migrate from another provider?

Absolutely! See our guide about migrations
[here](/overview/migrate-existing-users). Since every provider is
different, we can also manually help with the migration process. Get in touch at
support@propelauth.com.

### I logged in to my test environment but my frontend doesn't say I'm logged in

For privacy reasons, some browsers will restrict sending cookies across domains.
In your production environment, this isn't an issue because you have a custom
domain (`https://auth.yourdomain.com`).

This can be an issue for your test environment which sends requests from
localhost to your test environment (e.g. `https://yourid.propelauthtest.com`).
Resolving this is different in each browser.

In Firefox, for example, if you have enabled **Strict** Enhanced Tracking
Protection, you'll need to disable it just for localhost by clicking the shield
next to the url like this:

<Note>
  This is only applicable locally for some configurations of some browsers. Your
  end users will **not** need to do this.
