PropelAuth provides signup, login, profile/account, and team management pages
so you don't have to worry about building them. These will also handle advanced cases like enrolling users in
2FA, collecting additional metadata, and more.

PropelAuth's prebuilt dashboard is a management tool that has everything you and your team need to configure your authentication preferences, 
manage users, and configure organizations, all in one place.

## B2B Tools

From the dashboard, you can view, create, and manage your users, organizations, and API Keys. At a glance you can find important information like which organizations specific users 
are members of, or if an organization can create SAML connections.

## Configuration

You can customize the settings on a project level basis through various configuration tools. Everything from custom roles and permissions, to adjusting the style of 
our hosted UI's, to creating webhooks, can be done through the dashboard.

## Integration

From the dashboard, you configure all aspects of integrating your product with PropelAuth, from setting up the URL for your hosted pages, to the redirect pats after 
successfull logins, to creating keys for backend integrations.
