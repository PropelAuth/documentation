PropelAuth provides signup, login, profile/account, and team management pages
so you don't have to worry about building them. These will also handle advanced cases like enrolling users in
2FA, collecting additional metadata, and more.

PropelAuth's prebuilt dashboard is a management tool that has everything you and your team need to configure your authentication preferences, 
manage users, and configure organizations, all in one place.

## B2B Tools 

![users page of the dashboard](/images/dashboard.png)

From the dashboard, you can view, create, and manage your users, organizations, and API Keys. At a glance you can find important information like which organizations specific users 
are members of, or if an organization can create SAML connections.

## Insights

![metrics on the dashboard](/images/dashboard-metrics.png)

As soon as you load into the dashboard, you're greeted with a glance at the metrics you care about. We collect the total number of users, the total number of organizations, 
and month-over-month measurements of user signups, active users, and active organizations. Look forward to even more insights in the future!

Additionally, under the User Insights tab, you can view a few reports: Churned Users and Reengaged Users.

<Note>User Insights are a paid feature. While you can use this feature in your Test environment, you must be on a paid plan in order to view these reports in Production.</Note>

Churned Users displays the users that have not been active in the last 7, 14, or 30 days, meaning that they have not had a token refreshed in those periods. Churned 
Organizations displays organizations where all users haven't been active in 7, 14, or 30 days. These reports provide early insights into customers who haven't used 
the product for a specified period, allowing you to focus on retention efforts.

Reengaged Users displays the users that have had a token refreshed in the last week or month, previously considered inactive in that selected period. Reengaged 
Organizations displays the same information but for organizations where at least one user has had their token refreshed. These reports can give your team an early 
indication of the success of your efforts to reduce churn.

## Configuration

You can customize the settings on a project level basis through various configuration tools. Everything from custom roles and permissions, to adjusting the style of 
our hosted UI's, to creating webhooks, can be done through the dashboard.

## Integration

From the dashboard, you configure all aspects of integrating your product with PropelAuth, from setting up the URL for your hosted pages, to the redirect pats after 
successfull logins, to creating keys for backend integrations.
