PropelAuth's [SAML SSO](https://www.propelauth.com/post/what-does-saml-actually-mean) support allows your users to
connect their organizations their own identity provider (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, JumpCloud, etc).

As an example, lets say you have a customer "Acme Co". Acme uses
Okta as their identity provider, meaning that all employees at the company
have an account with Okta. New employees are onboarded to Okta and
exiting employees are removed.

A SAML connection between your product and Acme allows employees at Acme to sign in to your product with their existing work accounts.

## No need to write any extra code

PropelAuth's libraries have a concept of an [organization](/overview/organizations).
Users are added to these organizations via invitations or joining by their domain.

One of the best things about our SAML integration, is your code doesn't need to change at all when you close your first
customer that needs it. SAML is an implementation detail of how an organization
manages their users within your product. Any code you write that deals with organizations will work, regardless of
the method that organization uses to manage its members.

## Who can set up SAML?

With the click of a button, you can allow all of your organizations to set up
SAML connections with you. However, you may not want that if you consider SAML
to be an enterprise/paid feature.

You can also select which organizations can use SAML either in your dashboard or
programmatically via our APIs.
