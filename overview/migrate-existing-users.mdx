title: "Migrate users from an existing auth source"
description:
  "If you switch your auth provider, there are a few major considerations to
  take into account."
---

For example:

- I have user IDs already persisted in my database, how can I maintain those
  IDs?
- How can I allow my users to keep their existing password?
- Some of my users have 2FA enabled, how do I make sure they keep in enabled?
- Can I test the migration before committing to it?

Ideally, there's no user impact and a simple API to use. Luckily, we have a
[simple API](/reference/backend-apis/api) that you can use to migrate your
users. Each of our backend libraries has an API wrapper that you can use called
`migrateUserFromExternalSource`.

### Linking user IDs

Our migration API also takes in the user's existing ID, and we will present a
`legacy_user_id` everywhere alongside our `user_id`. This allows you to use the
`legacy_user_id` whenever it's present, and fallback to new `user_ids` for any
user created after the migration.

### Maintaining users' passwords

Passwords should **never** be stored in plaintext or any recoverable form. Our
migration API doesn't take in a password, it takes in a password hash. We
support both BCrypt and Argon2 hashes and by providing your user's password
hash, they will be able to log in with their existing password.

### Maintaining MFA

Our migration API also optionally takes in a base32 encoded MFA secret. If you
pass one in, we'll enable MFA for your user's account automatically and their
existing MFA device's codes will work just like they currently do.

### Testing the migration

All this works in both your production and test environments, allowing you to
test the migration before fully committing to it.
