When a user visits your frontend application, your frontend can make a request
to PropelAuth to determine if the current user is logged in. If the user is
logged in, you will receive a JSON Web Token (JWT)
[access token](/overview/access-tokens) and the user’s metadata.
For more information on JWTs, view our blog
[here](https://www.propelauth.com/post/jwts-explained-with-code-examples). Once
you have the user’s access token, your backend can validate and identify the
token’s owner. This validation is done entirely on your backend and does not
need to make any requests to PropelAuth. Access tokens are short-lived, and our
libraries will refresh them both periodically and when the user switches tabs or
reconnects to the internet.

A secure HTTP-only cookie is created once a user logs into your hosted
authentication page. This cookie allows PropelAuth to identify logged-in users.
In your production environment, we require you use a custom domain to avoid
third-party cookie issues for your users. Browsers like Safari, for example,
will block cookies across domains. For this reason, we include custom domains in
all of our [plans](https://www.propelauth.com/pricing).
