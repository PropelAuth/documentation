As part of getting users live quickly, PropelAuth provides signup, login, profile/account, and team management pages
so you donâ€™t have to worry about building them. These will also handle advanced cases like enrolling users in
2FA, collecting additional metadata, and more.

## Customizability

These pages are fully customizable and will appear
under <Tooltip tip="https://auth.yourdomain.com">your domain name</Tooltip> so
it feels like part of your application. You can view a demo of some of these pages [here](https://demo.propelauth.com)

You can choose which authentication methods you want to provide to your customers and then we'll take care of the rest.
This includes password, passwordless, SSO (social login), and enterprise SSO (SAML).
