PropelAuth provides [hosted UIs](/overview/hosted-pages), one of which is an account page for your users.
This account page has a 2FA enrollment UI that your users can use to enroll in 2FA, view their backup codes, and disable 2FA.

_We manage the entire 2FA process, including enrollment UI._

You do not have to write any additional code to provide your users with 2FA.
The hosted pages will take care of everything.
