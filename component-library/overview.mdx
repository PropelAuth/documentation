PropelAuth provides a React-based component library for drop-in authentication. If you're looking for out-of-the-box authentication with maximum customizability, the component library is the solution for you.

## Concepts

There are a few concepts you'll need to understand to make full use of the component library: Components, Elements, and Appearances.

[Components](/component-library/components/login-manager) contain all the functionality you need for a specific task. For example, you can easily add signup functionality to your application with the [Signup](/component-library/components/signup) component.

_Elements_ are the lower-level primitives that make up a Component, like Buttons and Containers. You can customize Elements with the [Appearance](/component-library/getting-started/customization) object, which lets you apply classes and styles to Elements, or override them completely.

Lastly, you can use _Adapter Libraries_ (coming soon) to adapt our components to the component libraries you already know and use, like [MUI](/component-library/adapter-libraries/mui).
