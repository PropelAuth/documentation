PropelAuth provides a React-based component library for drop-in authentication, organizations and user management. If you're looking for out-of-the-box authentication with maximum customizability, the component library is the solution for you.

## Concepts

There are three main concepts you'll need to understand to make full use of the component library: Components, Elements, and Adapter Libraries.

_Components_ contain all the functionality you need for authentication, organizations and user management. For example, you can use the [Login](/component-library/components/Login) to handle email-based login, social logins, and magic links right out of the box.

_Elements_ are the lower-level primitives that make up a Component, like [Buttons](/component-library/elements/button) and [Containers](/component-library/elements/container). You can apply classes and styles to Elements, or override them completely.

Lastly, you can use _Adapter Libraries_ to adapt our components to the libraries you already know and use, like [MUI](/component-library/adapter-libraries/mui).
