## Installation

To get started, you'll first need to install the PropelAuth [React](https://github.com/PropelAuth/react) library. You'll also need a set of underlying elements for the component library to use. This could be our official [Base Elements](https://github.com/PropelAuth/base-elements) or an Adapter Library like [MUI](/component-library/adapter-libraries/mui).

```shell
npm install @propelauth/react @propelauth/base-elements
```

## Usage

The following code snippet demonstrates a simple React application that uses the [Login](/component-library/components/Login) component to log in users and direct them to the dashboard.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { Login } from "@propelauth/react";

export default function App() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <div>
      <Login onSuccess={() => navigate("/dashboard")} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customization

Every component can be deeply customized with the _appearance_ prop. The appearance prop is an object that lets you specify component-level options, as well as apply styles and classes to elements in a component. You can even completely override elements if you'd like.

Let's use the appearance prop to customize the Login component from the example above. To do this, we can use the appearance prop

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { Login } from "@propelauth/react";

export default function App() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const loginAppearance = {
    options: {
      headerContent: "Sign In",
      divider: false
    },
    elements: {
      Container: { backgroundColor: "#000000" }
      SubmitButton: 'custom-class'
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Login
        onSuccess={() => navigate("/dashboard")}
        appearance={loginAppearance}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
