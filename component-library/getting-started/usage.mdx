## Installation

To get started, you'll first need to install the [@PropelAuth/react](https://github.com/PropelAuth/react) library. You'll also need a set of underlying elements for the component library to use. This could be our official [Base Elements](https://github.com/PropelAuth/base-elements) or an Adapter Library like [MUI](/component-library/adapter-libraries/mui) (coming soon).

```shell
npm install @propelauth/react @propelauth/base-elements
```

## Usage

Once installation is complete, you'll need to wrap your application with the `ComponentLibraryProvider`. Be sure to pass in the elements you'd like to use with the `elements` prop. You can also specify an `appearance` prop in the provider to apply [customizations](/component-library/getting-started/customization) to elements globally.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { AuthProvider, ComponentLibraryProvider } from "@propelauth/react";
import { BaseElements } from "@propelauth/base-elements";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(
  <AuthProvider authUrl={process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_URL}>
    <ComponentLibraryProvider elements={BaseElements}>
      <App />
    </ComponentLibraryProvider>
  </AuthProvider>
);
```

Then, in our `App` component, we can use the [LoginManager](/component-library/components/login-manager) component to handle the login process and direct users to the dashboard after they log in.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { LoginManager } from "@propelauth/react";

export default function App() {
  const redirectToYourProduct = () => {
    // This is dependent on your framework
    // For Next.js, you'll want router.push("/example")
    // for React Router, it's navigate("/example")
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <LoginManager onLoginCompleted={redirectToYourProduct} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
