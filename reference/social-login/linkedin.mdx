Enabling `Sign in with LinkedIn` only requires two fields: **Client ID** and
**Client secret**. Both of these are provided by LinkedIn, and these steps will
help you create them.

<Note>
  Users that sign up via LinkedIn look the same as users that sign up via any
  other method. Your code will handle both automatically.

### Step-by-step Instructions

Start by going to https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps

If you don't have one already, click **Create An App** and follow the
instructions to create one.

3. After creating an App, click **Products** and select **Sign In With
   LinkedIn**. This will configure your product with the correct permissions to
   log users in.

4. Next, click **Auth** and you will see your Client ID and Client Secret.

5. Back in your [PropelAuth project](https://app.propelauth.com/), under
   **Social Logins**, you enter your Client ID and Client Secret for LinkedIn.

6. After entering those values, note the callback URLs that PropelAuth provides.
   PropelAuth handles the OAuth flow on your behalf, so all we have to do is
   tell LinkedIn to allow these callback URLs.

7. Under **Redirect URLs**, enter PropelAuth's provided URL(s).

And that's it! When you go to your hosted authentication pages, you should see
the `Sign in with LinkedIn` button.
