Enabling `Sign in with Microsoft` only requires two fields: **Client ID** and
**Client secret**. Both of these are provided by Azure, and these steps will
help you create them.

<Note>
  Users that sign up via Microsoft look the same as users that sign up via any
  other method. Your code will handle both automatically.

### Step-by-step Instructions

1. Start by going to https://portal.azure.com/
2. Next, search for **App Registrations**
3. If you don't have one already, click **Create An App** and follow the
   instructions to create one. You can choose if you want to limit signups to
   business accounts, personal accounts, or both.

4. After creating an App, first copy the Client ID.

5. Back in your [PropelAuth project](https://app.propelauth.com/), under
   **Social Logins**, you enter your Client ID for Microsoft.

6. Next, we need to get the Client Secret, so back in the Azure portal, click
   **Add a certificate or secret**, and then click **New client secret**.

7. Enter a name for your secret and a duration.

8. Then copy the provided Client Secret, and paste it back in your
   [PropelAuth project](https://app.propelauth.com/), where you previously
   pasted your Client ID.

9. After entering the secret, note the callback URLs that PropelAuth provides.
   PropelAuth handles the OAuth flow on your behalf, so all we have to do is
   tell Microsoft to allow these callback URLs.

10. Click **Authentication** in the sidebar, and then click **Add a Platform**.
    Choose **Web** and enter PropelAuth's provided URL(s). Note that if you have
    two to enter (one for test, one for prod), you can only enter one on this
    screen, but you'll be allowed to add more after.

And that's it! When you go to your hosted authentication pages, you should see
the `Sign in with Microsoft` button.
