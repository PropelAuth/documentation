Enabling `Sign in with Google` only requires two fields: **Client ID** and
**Client secret**. Both of these are provided by Google, and these steps will
help you create them.

The official Google guide is
[here](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en). You'll be
following the guide to create an OAuth 2.0 client, and PropelAuth will manage
the OAuth workflow.

<Note>
  Users that sign up via Google look the same as users that sign up via any
  other method. Your code will handle both automatically.
</Note>

### Steps

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. From the projects list, select a project or create a new one.
3. On the left side menu, select APIs & services.
4. Click Credentials.
5. If you have never created an OAuth consent screen (what your users will see
   after clicking `Sign in with Google`), you will be prompted to fill that out
   first. Fill in the information for your application.
6. Click Create Credentials, then select OAuth client ID.
7. Select `Web application` for your Application type.
8. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, enter PropelAuth's provided URI. You can
   find this on the **Social Logins** section for your
   [PropelAuth](https://auth.propelauth.com/signup) project.
9. Click Create, note down the Client ID and Client secret you are provided.
10. On the **Social Logins** section for your
    [PropelAuth project](https://auth.propelauth.com/signup), enter your Client
    ID and Client **secret**. Click enable and save.

When you go to your hosted authentication pages, you should see the
`Sign in with Google` button.
