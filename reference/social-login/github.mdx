Enabling `Sign in with Github` only requires two fields: **Client ID** and
**Client secret**. Both of these are provided by Github, and these steps will
help you create them.

The official Github guide is
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

<Note>
  Users that sign up via Github look the same as users that sign up via any
  other method. Your code will handle both automatically.
</Note>

### Steps

1. Follow the
   [official Github guide to create an OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
2. Under **Authorized callback URL**, enter PropelAuth's provided URL. You can
   find this on the **Social Logins** section for your
   [PropelAuth project](https://auth.propelauth.com/signup).
3. Note down the **Client ID** and **Client secret** you are provided.
4. On the **Social Logins** section for your
   [PropelAuth project](https://auth.propelauth.com/signup), enter your Client
   ID and Client **secret**. Click enable and save.

When you go to your hosted authentication pages, you should see the
`Sign in with Github` button.
