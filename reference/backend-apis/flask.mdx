### Installation

```bash pip
$ pip install propelauth-flask
```

## Initialize

**init_auth** performs a one-time initialization of the library. It will verify your `api_key` is correct and fetch the
metadata needed to verify access tokens in [require_user](#require-user), [optional_user](#optional-user), or [require_org_member](#require-org-member).

```python
from propelauth_flask import init_auth

auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Protect API routes

### require_user

A decorator that will verify the request was made by a valid user. Specifically,
it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
with a `401` status code.
2. Set [current_user](#current-user) (scoped to the current request) with the user's
information.

```python
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@app.route("/api/whoami")
@auth.require_user
def who_am_i():
    """This route is protected, current_user is always set"""
    return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
```

### optional_user

Similar to [require_user](#require-user), except if an access token is missing or invalid, the request is allowed to
continue, but `current_user.exists()` will be `False`.

```python
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@app.route("/api/whoami_optional")
@auth.optional_user
def who_am_i_optional():
    if current_user.exists():
        return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
    return {}
```

### current_user

A per-request value that contains user information for the user making the request. It's set by one of
[require_user](#require-user), [optional_user](#optional-user), or [require_org_member](#require-org-member).

| exists()                  | A function that returns True if the user is logged in and False otherwise. You only need to check this if you are using [optional_user](#optional-user), otherwise it always returns True. |

The values of `org_id_to_org_member_info` are `OrgMemberInfo`'s, with the
following fields/functions:

| Property | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### require_org_member

A decorator that will verify the request was made by a valid user that belongs
to a specific organization.

<CodeGroup>

```python Basic example
@app.route("/org/<org_id>/check")
@auth.require_org_member()
def hello(org_id):
    return f"You are in {current_org.org_name}"
```

```python Advanced example
# Expect users to query with /hello?org_id=...
def org_id_in_query_extractor(req):
    return req.args.get('org_id')

@app.route("/hello")
@auth.require_org_member(req_to_org_id=org_id_in_query_extractor)
def hello():
    return f"You are in {current_org.org_name}"
```

</CodeGroup>

| require_org_member Argument | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| req_to_org_id               | A function that takes in the request and outputs the **org_id** to require the user to be a member of. If none is specified, it will check for a path param **org_id**.                                                |

Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
with a `401` status code.
2. Set [current_user](#current-user) (scoped to the current request)
with the user's information.
3. Find an id for an organization within the request. By default, it will check
for a path parameter **org_id**.
4. Check that the user is a member of that organization. If not, the request is
rejected with a `403` status code.
5. Set [current_org](#current-org)
(scoped to the current request) with the organization's information for this
user.

### current_org

A per-request value that contains org information for the user making the
request. It's set by [require_org_member](#require-org-member).

| Property                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| user_has_permission(permission: str): bool             | Return True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |
| user_has_all_permissions(permissions: List[str]): bool | Return True if the user has all the specified permissions. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                            |

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured.
These roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If you want to check a user's role, you can use **auth.require_org_member_with_exact_role** or **auth.require_org_member_with_minimum_role**.

```python
## Assuming a Role structure of Owner => Admin => Member

@app.route("/org/<org_id>/admin")
@auth.require_org_member_with_exact_role("Admin")
def admin(org_id):
   return f"You are an Admin of {current_org.org_name}"

@app.route("/org/<org_id>/admin_or_owner")
@auth.require_org_member_with_minimum_role("Admin")
def admin_or_owner(org_id):
   return f"You are an Admin or Owner of {current_org.org_name}"
```

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example, **can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**,
and **ReadOnly** are all valid permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **auth.require_org_member_with_permission** or **auth.require_org_member_with_all_permissions** to check for a given permission.

```python
@app.route("/org/<org_id>/billing")
@auth.require_org_member_with_permission("can_view_billing")
def billing(org_id):
   pass
```

All of these functions, just like [require_org_member](#require-org-member),
will also take in **req_to_org_id**, and will set both [current_user](#current-user) and [current_org](#current-org) on a valid request.

## Fetch user metadata by id

```python
# auth object comes from init_auth
auth.fetch_user_metadata_by_user_id(user_id, include_orgs=False)

Successful response is the same as [fetch_user_metadata_by_user_id](#fetch-user-metadata-by-id), expect it takes an email as an argument.

## Fetch user metadata by username

```python
# auth object comes from init_auth
auth.fetch_user_metadata_by_username(email, include_orgs=False)
```

Successful response is the same as [fetch_user_metadata_by_user_id](#fetch-user-metadata-by-id), expect it takes a username as an argument.

## Batch fetch users by ids

```python
# auth object comes from init_auth

## Batch fetch users by emails

```python
# auth object comes from init_auth
auth.fetch_batch_user_metadata_by_emails(["a@example.com", "b@example.com"], include_orgs=True)
```

Successful response is the same as [Batch fetch users by ids](#batch-fetch-users-by-ids), but the keys are matching email addresses.

## Batch fetch users by usernames

```python

auth.fetch_batch_user_metadata_by_usernames(["usera", "userb", "userc"], include_orgs=True)
```

Successful response is the same as [Batch fetch users by ids](#batch-fetch-users-by-ids), but the keys are matching usernames.

## Search for users

```python
# auth object comes from init_auth
auth.fetch_users_by_query(page_size=10, page_number=0, order_by=UserQueryOrderBy.CREATED_AT_ASC,
                          email_or_username=None, include_orgs=False)

## Migrate User from External Source

A similar function to [Create User](#create-user), but for cases where you already have a user stored in an external system.
You can, for example, pass in a password hash for an existing user, and they will be able to login with their same password.
It is also possible to provide an existing identifier, and we will store and return it along with our future identifiers, allowing you to link them.


```py
# auth object comes from init_auth
auth.migrate_user_from_external_source(email, email_confirmed,
                                       existing_user_id=None, existing_password_hash=None,
                                       existing_mfa_base32_encoded_secret=None,
                                       ask_user_to_update_password_on_login=False,
                                       enabled=None, first_name=None, last_name=None, username=None)

## Create magic link

Creates a magic link that a user can use to log in. Use this API if you'd prefer to send the magic link to the customer yourself, otherwise, we have [Create User](#create-user) which will email them directly.

## Create Access Token

Our frontend libraries allow you to get [access tokens](/overview/access-tokens) that can be sent to the backend.
The backend is then responsible for verifying these tokens.

For testing purposes, you may want to create access tokens separately from the frontend and set a custom expiration time.
With this API, you can create access tokens for users programmatically and set a custom expiration.

```python
# auth object comes from init_auth
auth.create_access_token(user_id, duration_in_minutes)
```

| Argument                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
