### Installation

```bash npm
$ pip install propelauth-flask
```

### Initialize

initAuth performs a one-time initialization of the library. It will verify your
`apiKey` is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access tokens in
[require_user](/reference/backend-apis/flask/#requireuser),
[optional_user](/reference/backend-apis/flask/#optional-user), or
[require_org_member](/reference/backend-apis/flask/#require-org-member).

```js
from propelauth_flask import init_auth

auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", #
                 "YOUR_API_KEY") #
```

### Protect API routes

#### require_user

A decorator that will verify the request was made by a valid user. Specifically,
it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set **current_user** (scoped to the current request) with the user's
   information.

```js
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@app.route("/api/whoami")
@auth.require_user
def who_am_i():
    """This route is protected, current_user is always set"""
    return {"user_id": current_user.user_id} #
```

#### optional_user

Similar to [require_user](/reference/backend-apis/flask/#require-user), except if an
access token is missing or invalid, the request is allowed to continue, but
**user** on the **Request** will be **undefined**.

```js
from flask import Flask
from propelauth_flask import init_auth, current_user

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")

@app.route("/api/whoami_optional")
@auth.optional_user
def who_am_i_optional():
    if current_user.exists(): #
        return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
    return {}
```

### current_user

A per-request value that contains user information for the user making the
request. It's set by one of **require_user**, **optional_user**, or
**require_org_member**.

| org_id_to_org_member_info | A dictionary of org ids to metadata about the org. Includes all orgs that the user is in                                                                                 |
| legacy_user_id            | The original ID of the user, if the user was migrated from an external source                                                                                            |
| exists()                  | A function that returns True if the user is logged in and False otherwise. You only need to check this if you are using optional_user, otherwise it always returns True. |

The values of **org_id_to_org_member_info** are **OrgMemberInfo**'s, with the
following fields/functions:

| user_is_at_least_role(role: str): bool                 | Returns True if the user's role within the organization is at least the `role` passed in. If the hierarchy of roles is Owner => Admin => Member, specifying "Admin" will return True for Admins and Owners, but False for Members. |
| user_has_permission(permission: str): bool             | Return True if the user has a specific permission. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                                    |
| user_has_all_permissions(permissions: List[str]): bool | Return True if the user has all the specified permissions. The users' permissions are derived from their role within this organization.                                                                                            |

### require_org_member

A function that will verify that a user belongs to a specific organization.

```js
@app.route("/org/<org_id>/check")
@auth.require_org_member()
def hello(org_id):
   return f"You are in {current_org.org_name}"
```

Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
   with a `401` status code.
2. Set **current_user** (scoped to the current request) with the user's
   information.
3. Find an id for an organization within the request. By default, it will check
   for a path parameter **org_id**.
4. Check that the user is a member of that organization. If not, the request is
   rejected with a 403 status code.
5. Set **current_org** (scoped to the current request) with the organization's
   information for this user.

### Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles
are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured. These
roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If
you want to check a user's role, you can use
**require_org_member_with_minimum_role** or
**require_org_member_with_exact_role**.

```js
## Assuming a Role structure of Owner => Admin => Member

@app.route("/org/<org_id>/admin")
@auth.require_org_member_with_exact_role("Admin")
def admin(org_id):
   return f"You are an Admin of {current_org.org_name}"

@app.route("/org/<org_id>/admin_or_owner")
@auth.require_org_member_with_minimum_role("Admin")
def admin_or_owner(org_id):
   return f"You are an Admin or Owner of {current_org.org_name}"
```

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example,
can_view_billing, ProductA::CanCreate, and ReadOnly are all valid permissions.
The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use auth.require_org_member_with_permission or
auth.require_org_member_with_all_permissions to check for a given permission.

```js
@app.route("/org/<org_id>/billing")
@auth.require_org_member_with_permission("can_view_billing")
def billing(org_id):
   pass
```

All of these functions, just like **require_org_member**, will also take in
**req_to_org_id**, and will set both **current_user** and **current_org** on a
valid request.

### current_org

A per-request value that contains org information for the user making the
request. It's set by **require_org_member**.

### Fetch user metadata by email

```js
# auth object somes from init_auth
auth.fetch_user_metadata_by_email(email, include_orgs=False)
```

Successful response is the same as **fetch_user_metadata_by_user_id**, expect it
takes an email as an argument.

### Fetch user metadata by username

```js
# auth object somes from init_auth
auth.fetch_user_metadata_by_username(email, include_orgs=False)
```

Successful response is the same as **fetch_user_metadata_by_user_id**, expect it
takes a username as an argument.

### Batch fetch users by ids

```js
# auth object somes from init_auth
user_id_to_metadata = auth.fetch_batch_user_metadata_by_user_ids([
    "1be238f3-5908-4c51-b3bf-e53dd763047e",
    "beb00acf-6e48-435d-8388-3758607ec01b",
    "941c99e5-3530-4475-bd0f-bbc5d06603c3"
], include_orgs=False)
```

`user_id_to_metadata` will store a dictionary response as shown below:

<Note>
  Any IDs that don't have a match are not returned. Duplicate users are only
  returned once.

### Migrate User from External Source

Similar to **Create User**, but for cases where you already have a user stored
in an external system. You can, for example, pass in a password hash for an
existing user, and they will be able to login with their same password. It is
also possible to provide an existing identifier, and we will store and return it
along with our future identifiers, allowing you to link them.

```js
# auth object somes from init_auth
auth.migrate_user_from_external_source(email, email_confirmed,
                                       existing_user_id=None, existing_password_hash=None,
                                       existing_mfa_base32_encoded_secret=None,
