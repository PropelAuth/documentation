PropelAuth's Python library provides all the building blocks you need to add
authentication to any Python backend.

For most Python frameworks, like
[FastAPI](/getting-started/backend-apis/fastapi),
[Django](/getting-started/backend-apis/django), and
[Flask](/getting-started/backend-apis/flask), we have built out libraries specifically for them.
Those libraries will provide a more first-class experience than this library.

## Installation

```bash
pip install propelauth_py
```

## Initialize

**init_base_auth** performs a one-time initialization of the library.
It will verify your `api_key` is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access tokens in [**validate_access_token_and_get_user**](#validate-access-token-and-get-user) and [**validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org**](#validate-access-token-and-get-user-with-org).

```python
from propelauth_py import init_base_auth

auth = init_base_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Protect API routes

### validate_access_token_and_get_user

This function takes in the `Authorization` HTTP header and verifies the request
was made by a valid user. It expects the header to be in the format
`Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`. If the Authorization HTTP header is malformed or doesn't
contain a valid [access token](/overview/access-tokens), an
`UnauthorizedException` is thrown.

Otherwise, a [User](#user) is returned.

```python
auth_header = # get authorization header in the form `Bearer {TOKEN}`
try:
   user = auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user(auth_header)
   print("Logged in as", user.user_id)
except UnauthorizedException:
   print("Invalid access token")
```

### validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org

This function will verify that a request was made by a valid user AND that user
is in an organization.

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured.
These roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If you want to check a user's role, you can use **auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org_by_minimum_role** or **auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org_by_exact_role**
which will very the request was made by a valid user, that user is in the specified organization, AND that the user's within the organization matches what was passed in.

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example, **can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**,
and **ReadOnly** are all valid permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org_by_permission** or **auth.validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org_by_all_permissions** to check for a given permission.

All of these functions, just like [validate_access_token_and_get_user_with_org](#validate-access-token-and-get-user-with-org),
will take in an authorization header and an organization ID.
The last parameter is either a role, permission, or list of permissions depending on the function.

auth.fetch_user_metadata_by_email(email, include_orgs=False)
```

Successful response is the same as [fetch_user_metadata_by_user_id](#fetch-user-metadata-by-id), expect it takes an email as an argument.

```python
# auth object comes from init_base_auth
auth.fetch_user_metadata_by_username(email, include_orgs=False)
```

Successful response is the same as [fetch_user_metadata_by_user_id](#fetch-user-metadata-by-id), expect it takes a username as an argument.

## Batch fetch users by ids

```python
# auth object comes from init_base_auth
user_id_to_metadata = auth.fetch_batch_user_metadata_by_user_ids([

## Migrate User from External Source

A similar function to [Create User](#create-user), but for cases where you already have a user stored in an external system.
You can, for example, pass in a password hash for an existing user, and they will be able to login with their same password.
It is also possible to provide an existing identifier, and we will store and return it along with our future identifiers, allowing you to link them.


```py
# auth object comes from init_base_auth
auth.migrate_user_from_external_source(email, email_confirmed,
                                       existing_user_id=None, existing_password_hash=None,
                                       existing_mfa_base32_encoded_secret=None,
                                       ask_user_to_update_password_on_login=False,
                                       enabled=None, first_name=None, last_name=None, username=None)
```

## Create magic link

## Create Access Token

Our frontend libraries allow you to get [access tokens](/overview/access-tokens) that can be sent to the backend.
The backend is then responsible for verifying these tokens.

For testing purposes, you may want to create access tokens separately from the frontend and set a custom expiration time.
With this API, you can create access tokens for users programmatically and set a custom expiration.

```python
# auth object comes from init_base_auth
auth.create_access_token(user_id, duration_in_minutes)
```

| Argument                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| user_id | The user's ID |
| duration_in_minutes | How long the token is valid for, in minutes.  |
