## Installation

```bash pip
$ pip install propelauth_fastapi
```

## Initialize

**init_auth** performs a one-time initialization of the library.
It will verify your `api_key` is correct and fetch the metadata needed to verify access tokens in
[require_user](#require-user), [optional_user](#optional-user), or [require_org_member](#require-org-member).

```python
from propelauth_fastapi import init_auth

auth = init_auth("YOUR_AUTH_URL", "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Protect API routes

### require_user

A dependency that will verify the request was made by a valid user. If a valid
access token is provided, it will return that [user's information](#user) (including
fields like a user_id). If not, the request is rejected with a `401` status
code.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from propelauth_fastapi import init_auth, User

app = FastAPI()
auth = init_auth("AUTH_URL", "API_KEY")

@app.get("/")
async def root(current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    return {"message": f"Hello {current_user.user_id}"}
```

### optional_user

Similar to [require_user](#require-user), except if an access token is missing or invalid, the request is allowed to continue,
but the dependency will be None.

```python
from typing import Optional

from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from propelauth_fastapi import init_auth, User

app = FastAPI()
auth = init_auth("AUTH_URL", "API_KEY")

@app.get("/api/whoami_optional")
async def whoami_optional(current_user: Optional[User] = Depends(auth.optional_user)):
    if current_user:
        return {"user_id": current_user.user_id}
    return {}
```

### require_org_member

A function that will verify that a user belongs to a specific organization.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from propelauth_fastapi import init_auth, User

app = FastAPI()
auth = init_auth("AUTH_URL", "API_KEY")

@app.get("/api/org/{org_id}/check")
async def admin_only(org_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    org = auth.require_org_member(current_user, org_id)
    return {"message": f"You are in {org.org_name}"}
```

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| current_user    | The result of [require_user](#require-user)                                                                                                                                                      |
| required_org_id | The id of an organization. This function will check that the current user is a member of this org. Typically, this is passed in from the frontend as a query or path parameter. |

Specifically, it will:

1. Check that a valid access token was provided. If not, the request is rejected
with a `403` status code.
2. Return the organization's information for this user.

The returned organization is an [OrgMemberInfo](#org-member-info)

### User

A user returned by [require_user](#require-user) or [optional_user](#optional-user).

| Property                    | Description                                                                              |

| org_id_to_org_member_info   | A dictionary of org ids to metadata about the org. Includes all orgs that the user is in |
| legacy_user_id              | The original ID of the user, if the user was migrated from an external source            |

The values of **org_id_to_org_member_info** are [OrgMemberInfo](#org-member-info)'s.

### OrgMemberInfo

## Roles and Permissions

A user has a **Role** within an organization. By default, the available roles are **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**, but these can be configured.
These roles are also hierarchical, so Owner > Admin > Member.

Roles allow you to control what different users can do within your product. If you want to check a user's role, you can use **require_org_member_with_minimum_role** or **require_org_member_with_exact_role**.

```python
## Assuming a Role structure of Owner => Admin => Member

@app.get("/api/org/{org_id}/admin_only")
async def admin_only(org_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    org = auth.require_org_member_with_exact_role(current_user, org_id, "Admin")
    return {"message": f"You are an Admin of {org.org_name}"}

@app.get("/api/org/{org_id}/admin_or_owner")
async def admin_or_owner(org_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    org = auth.require_org_member_with_minimum_role(current_user, org_id, "Admin")
    return {"message": f"You are an Admin or Owner of {org.org_name}"}
```

Permissions are arbitrary strings associated with a role. For example, **can_view_billing**, **ProductA::CanCreate**,
and **ReadOnly** are all valid permissions. The PropelAuth dashboard allows you to set up these permissions.

You can use **require_org_member_with_permission** or **require_org_member_with_all_permissions** to check for a given permission.

```python
@app.get("/api/org/{org_id}/billing")
async def billing(org_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(auth.require_user)):
    org = auth.require_org_member_with_permission(current_user, org_id, "can_view_billing")
    pass
```

## Usage with API docs

FastAPIs built in documentation will automatically add this button when you are
using either `require_user` or `optional_user`.

![API docs authorize button](/images/authorize_button.png)

You can obtain an access token either from the frontend or by navigating to
`${YOUR_AUTH_URL}/api/v1/refresh_token`.

## Fetch user metadata by id

## Fetch user metadata by email

```python
# auth object somes from init_auth
auth.fetch_user_metadata_by_email(email, include_orgs=False)
```

Successful response is the same as [fetch_user_metadata_by_user_id](#fetch-user-metadata-by-id), expect it takes an email as an argument.

## Fetch user metadata by username

```python
# auth object somes from init_auth
auth.fetch_user_metadata_by_username(email, include_orgs=False)
```

Successful response is the same as [fetch_user_metadata_by_user_id](#fetch-user-metadata-by-id), expect it takes a username as an argument.

## Batch fetch users by ids

```python
# auth object somes from init_auth
user_id_to_metadata = auth.fetch_batch_user_metadata_by_user_ids([
    "1be238f3-5908-4c51-b3bf-e53dd763047e",
    "beb00acf-6e48-435d-8388-3758607ec01b",
    "941c99e5-3530-4475-bd0f-bbc5d06603c3"
], include_orgs=False)
```

<Note>
    Any IDs that don't have a match are not returned. Duplicate users are only returned once.
</Note>

`user_id_to_metadata` will store a dictionary response as shown below:

## Migrate User from External Source

A similar function to [Create User](#create-user), but for cases where you already have a user stored in an external system.
You can, for example, pass in a password hash for an existing user, and they will be able to login with their same password.
It is also possible to provide an existing identifier, and we will store and return it along with our future identifiers, allowing you to link them.


```py
# auth object somes from init_auth
auth.migrate_user_from_external_source(email, email_confirmed,
                                       existing_user_id=None, existing_password_hash=None,
