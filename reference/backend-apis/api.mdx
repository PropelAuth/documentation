<Note>
  You should prefer to use a library over the API directly. If a library for
  your language doesn't exist yet, please reach out to support@propelauth.com
  and we'll be happy to help.

### Authentication

PropelAuth uses API keys for the backend API. You can manage your API key(s)
under the **Backend Integration** section of your project at
https://app.propelauth.com.

PropelAuth expects the API key in an Authorization header like the following:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Domain

PropelAuth uses a different domain for each application. Your application, for
example, will be hosted at `https://auth.yourdomain.com`. An HTTP Request of
/api/v1/example should be `https://auth.yourdomain.com/api/v1/example` in that
case.

You can set your domain under the **Go Live** section of your project.
