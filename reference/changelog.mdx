### 2023-03-15

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Feature** | Added an API to create access tokens for testing purposes. Previously, you would need to use our frontend libraries to get tokens, and the tokens were all short-lived. Now you can make an API call to get an access token for a specified user, with a custom expiration. |
| **Feature** | Added `refreshAuthInfo` to @propelauth/react so you can force refresh the auth information |
| **Feature** | Improved `useAuthInfo` so that you can now destructure without needing to check `loading` first |
| **Feature** | Added new redirect function `redirectToSetupSAMLPage` |
| **Feature** | For each redirect function (e.g. redirectToLoginPage), we now also provide a getter function to get the underlying URL (e.g. getLoginPageURL). This allows for more flexible usage. |
| **Bugfix** | Fixed issue with `fetch_org` in the Rust crate |
| **Bugfix** | Updating your email no longer sends a confirmation if you had "email confirmation not required" in that environment |

### 2023-03-01

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Release** | Released support for [Chrome Extensions](https://www.propelauth.com/post/chrome-extension-authentication-with-plasmo) alongside Plasmo |
| **Beta** | Beta support for API authentication. You can generate API keys for your customers tied to either your users, your organizations, or both. |
| **Bugfix** | Fixed issue with propelauth-py which made it fail to build on some OS's |
| **Bugfix** | Fixed issue with Google login where it wasn't always updating the user object with their name |

### 2023-02-14

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Beta** | Beta release for our [Component Library](https://www.propelauth.com/post/propelauths-customizable-login-components)! |
| **Release** | Updated our [example apps](/example-apps/overview) section with new examples and forkable git repos |
| **Feature** | Updated our libraries with a new optional boolean field **askUserToUpdatePasswordOnLogin** in all three of: createUser, migrateUser, and updatePassword. This forces the user to set/update their password. |
| **Feature** | You can now disable password authentication in the dashboard. |
| **Feature** | Added options for you to specify how long your users remain logged in and whether it's based on inactivity or just a fixed amount of time |
| **Feature** | Added deeper organization configuration options, like requiring all users to be in at least one org. |

### 2023-01-18

|--|----|

| **Release** | Added backend support for [Rust](https://www.propelauth.com/post/rust-authentication-with-propelauth) with support for Axum and Actix. |
| **Feature** | Added APIs to make it easier to programmatically manage your users (managing/deleting orgs, updating user metadata, etc.) |
| **Feature** | Added a new webhook on user login. |
| **Bugfix** | Cleaned up the workflow around verifying a domain. You can now verify ownership via a TXT record on a special subdomain, instead of using the root domain. |
| **Beta** | User login duration can be configured now. You can either specify an absolute amount of time the user is logged in, or a period of inactivity, after which they will be logged out. |

### 2022-12-05

| Category | Description |
|--|----|

| **Feature** | Added an option for copying user IDs out of the dashboard. |
| **Bugfix** | Updated copy on the default create org page |

### 2022-11-18

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Release** | [Custom Roles & Permissions (RBAC)](https://www.propelauth.com/post/adding-customizable-roles-and-permissions) is live! This feature enables you to create custom roles and permissions. We also updated all our libraries to add advanced authorization with these roles and permissions. |
| **Feature** | Added the concept of an [**active organization**](https://www.propelauth.com/post/react-hooks-for-multi-tenancy-and-authorization-w-propelauth) (see getActiveOrgFn). For users in multiple organizations, this allows you to set the organization they are operating within and works with the roles and permissions update. |
| **Beta** | Added option to disable signups from personal email domains (e.g. gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc). |

### 2022-10-28

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Feature** | Added the ability to disable 2FA/MFA for your users either programmatically or through our dashboard |
| **Feature** | Added the ability to [customize what you call "Organizations"](https://www.propelauth.com/post/custom-organization-naming). This will automatically update all the hosted UIs and user facing error messages. |
| **Feature** | When logging a user in, you can specify where to redirect the user outside of the default redirect URL. |
| **Bugfix** | You can now create organizations even if the feature is disabled. This allows for a smoother process of migrating to organizations if you are already live. |
| **Beta** | Added more options to the concept of organizations. You can require that your users are in at least one organization, require that users must log in directly to their organization, and more. Reach out if you'd like to try this out. |
| **Beta** | Added more granular controls over which domains/subdomains can access authentication information. This includes creating staging environments that can be reached by localhost, having a small set of subdomains that are NOT allowed to check if a user is logged in (for vendors you might not trust), and more. |

### 2022-09-30

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Release** | [Self-service SAML](https://www.propelauth.com/post/propelauth-launches-self-service-saml) is live! This feature allows your customers to log in to your product using their existing identity provider, like Okta, Google, OneLogin, and more. |
| **Feature** | Added support for Azure AD to our list of SAML IDPs, including documentation for your customers |
| **Feature** | Added additional APIs for our backend libraries for enabling/disabling/deleting users. Also handles logging users out remotely. |

### 2022-09-16

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Feature** | Added new APIs for disabling, enabling, and deleting users. Disabling/Deleting a user will both log them out and prevent them from logging back in. |
| **Feature** | Added option for your users to test their SAML connections before enabling them. |
| **Feature** | Added new APIs for explicitly picking which organizations can login via SAML. This can also be done via the dashboard, or you can enable it globally for all organizations.  |
| **Bugfix** | @propelauth/react library was re-rendering more than it needed to. |
| **Release** | Created <a href="https://demo.propelauth.com" target="_blank">demo site</a> where you can experiment with different themes without needing to sign up. |

### 2022-07-29

| Category | Description |
|--|----|
| **Feature** | Allow subdomains of your application to also fetch authentication information. In other words, if you set https://example.com as your application URL, you can now set up additional authenticated applications at any subdomain like https://app.example.com. |
| **Feature** | Added option to disallow users from creating their own organizations. They can still manage the organization and invite new users, but it allows you to create and setup organizations on their behalf. |
| **Bugfix** | Added `event_type` to webhooks to make it easier to distinguish |
