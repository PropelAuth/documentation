  "Social login (SSO) allows your users to login using their existing accounts
  (e.g. Google, Facebook, Twitter). It makes signing up simpler for your users,
  as they don't have to remember a password."

Enabling social logins with PropelAuth is a breeze since the majority of the
work is done by your hosted authentication pages. If a user signs up with a
social provider after signing up with email, their accounts will automatically
be linked.

See below for a full list of providers with detailed instructions.
